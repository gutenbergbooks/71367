<small>AND THE<br>
GALLOPING SNAIL</small></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br>

<small>THE GALLOPING SNAIL</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span> fagged out, I dragged myself wearily from the
sun-baked concrete highway to the skinny shade of a
thin-limbed, thirsty-looking bush.</p>

<p>“Under the spreading blacksmith tree the village
chestnut sits,” I crazily recited, kicking off my
shoes to cool my blistered feet. Then I looked at
my chum with begging eyes. “Get me some ice
cream, Poppy. Quick, before I faint.”</p>

<p>Boy, was I ever hot! I felt like a fried egg. But
scorched as I was, inside and out, I could still sing
a song.</p>

<p>To better introduce myself, I’ll explain that my
name is Jerry Todd. I live in Tutter, Illinois, which
is the peachiest small town in the state. And the
kids I run around with are the peachiest boy pals
in the state, too, particularly Poppy Ott, the hero
of this crazy story.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>Poppy is a real guy, let me whisper to you. I
never expect to have a chum whom I like any better
than I like him. He’s full of fun, just like his funny
name, which he got from peddling pop corn. And
<i>brains</i>? Say, when they were dishing out gray matter
old Poppy got served at both ends of the line. I’ll
tell the world. If you want to know how smart he
is, just read POPPY OTT’S SEVEN-LEAGUE
STILTS. Starting with nothing except an idea, we
ended up, under his clever leadership, with a factory
full of stilt-manufacturing machinery and money
in the bank. That’s Poppy for you. Every time.
A lot of his ideas are pretty big for a boy, but he
makes them work. Of course, as he warmly admits,
I was a big help to him in putting the new stilt
business on its feet and teaching it to stand alone.
But his loyal praise doesn’t puff me up. For I
know who did the most of the headwork.</p>

<p>With Poppy’s pa doing the general-manager stuff
in the new factory, my chum and I had merrily set
forth on a hitch-hike as a sort of vacation. This,
too, was Poppy’s idea. A hitch-hike, as every kid
knows, is a sort of free automobile tour. You start
walking down the concrete in the direction you want
to go, and when a motor car to your liking comes
alone you wigwag the driver to stop and give you a
lift. Sometimes you get it and sometimes you don’t.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
But if you limp a little bit, and act tired, that helps.</p>

<p>Poppy, of course, was all hip-hip-hurray over his
hitch-hike idea. That’s his way. Our most violent
exercise, he spread around, seeing nothing but joy
and sugar buns ahead, would be lifting our travel-weary
frames into soft-cushioned Cadillacs and
Packards. Once comfortably seated, we would glide
along swiftly and inexpensively. No gasoline bills
to pay. No new tires to buy. Everything free,
including the scenery. Some automobiles would
carry us ten miles, others would carry us a hundred
miles. “We might even average around three hundred
miles a day,” was some more of his line, “and
still have time each night to stop at a farmhouse and
do chores for our supper and breakfast.” If we slept
in the farmer’s barn, that would be free, too. Our
trip would cost us scarcely anything, though it would
be wise, the leader tacked on at the tail end, to carry
twenty dollars in small bills for emergencies.</p>

<p>I fell for the scheme, of course. For Poppy never
has any trouble getting me to do what he wants me
to do. Not that I haven’t a mind of my own. But
I’ve found out that in going along with him I usually
learn something worth while, and have a whale of
a lot of fun doing it, too.</p>

<p>Having won our parents’ consent to the trip, we
had set forth that morning in high feather. But in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
poor luck we now were held up on a closed road,
though why the road had been suddenly shut off
was a mystery to us.</p>

<p>With a final look up and down the long stretch of
concrete, Poppy came over to where I was and
dropped down beside me in the hot sand.</p>

<p>“Still not a sign of a car,” says he.</p>

<p>“Not even a flivver, huh?” I suffered with him.</p>

<p>“I can’t understand it,” says he, puzzled. “We
saw a few cars after we left Pardyville. But the
road’s completely empty now, and has been for
hours.”</p>

<p>I saw a chance to have some fun with him.</p>

<p>“‘And our most violent exercise,’” I quoted glibly,
“‘will be lifting our travel-weary frames into soft-cushioned
cattle racks and pant hards.’ Say, Poppy,”
I grinned, “was that last cattle rack we rode in a
four-legged wheelbarrow or another gnash?”</p>

<p>“You won’t feel so funny,” came the laugh, “if
you have to go to bed to-night without your supper.”</p>

<p>“Bed?” says I, looking around at the sun-baked
scenery. It was a beautiful country, all right—for
sand burs and grasshoppers! “Where’s the bed?”
I yawned. “Lead me to it.”</p>

<p>“This sand knoll may be the only bed you’ll get.
For there isn’t a farmhouse in sight.”</p>

<p>I got my eyes on something.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>“The Hotel Emporia for me, kid,” I laughed,
pointing to a billboard beside the highway. “‘One
hundred comfortable rooms,’” I read, “‘each with
bath and running ice water. Delectable chicken
dinners. Sun-room cafeteria. Inexpensive garage
in connection.’ Who could ask for more?” I wound
up.</p>

<p>“Jerry, don’t you ever run down?”</p>

<p>“Hey!” I yipped, straightening. “What do you
think I am?—a clock?”</p>

<p>“Yah,” came the quick grin, “a <i>cuckoo</i> clock.”</p>

<p>“It took real brains to think up that one, kid.
You win.”</p>

<p>“It’s a cinch,” the leader then went on, “that
they aren’t letting any cars into this road. For we
haven’t seen an automobile since three o’clock.
And it’s after six now.”</p>

<p>“Supper time, huh?”</p>

<p>“Yes, supper time, but no supper. Shall we
walk back to Pardyville, Jerry?”</p>

<p>“How would that help us?”</p>

<p>“The automobiles must detour from there.”</p>

<p>“First let us sleuth the road map,” I suggested,
“and find out where we are.”</p>

<p>“Here’s Pardyville,” Poppy presently pointed out.</p>

<p>“We must be near New Zion,” says I, squinting
at the map. “See? Here’s a river running east<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
and west, with a concrete road on each side—C. H. O.
and C. H. P.”</p>

<p>“County Highway ‘O’ and County Highway
‘P,’” Poppy explained.</p>

<p>“We must be on C. H. O.”</p>

<p>“That’s what the map says.”</p>

<p>“Come Here Often,” I made up of the three capital
letters, looking around at the Sahara sandscape.
“Yes, I will—not!”</p>

<p>“I should imagine,” came thoughtfully, as the
leader studied the map, “that a better scheme than
going back will be to cross the river at New Zion
and pick up the other road. For both roads lead into
Sandy Ridge. And that’s our next regular town.”</p>

<p>“How far have we come?” I inquired.</p>

<p>The leader got out his “log” book.</p>

<p>“About sixty-two miles.”</p>

<p>“What!” I squeaked. “Has it taken us all day
to cover sixty-two miles?”</p>

<p>“Here’s the dope: The first automobile carried us
twelve miles. The next one kissed a telephone
pole before it had gone a mile. The third one got
on the wrong road and we lost seven miles. The
fourth one—”</p>

<p>I let out a yip.</p>

<p>“The end of a perfectless day!” I sang noisily.
“And you were the bird,” I threw at him, “who said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
that some automobiles would carry us a hundred
miles at a jump. Poppy! Poppy! I believed in
you, and now my sugar is salt.”</p>

<p>“I guess I put it pretty strong,” says he, with a
sheepish look.</p>

<p>“I guess you did. Sixty-two miles! Hold my
head, I’m dizzy.”</p>

<p>“Anyway,” he added, “you can’t blame me
because they suddenly closed this road.”</p>

<p>“I suppose not,” I let up on him. “But just the
same I feel like a victim of circumstances, as the
tomcat said when it sat down on the fly paper.”</p>

<p>We got up then. And taking to the concrete
again, we kept our ears sharpened for the sound of an
automobile, for it didn’t seem possible to us that the
fine highway could much longer remain closed. But
all we heard in the desolate strip of country was the
rasping applause of happy-go-lucky crickets and the
occasional bagpipe notes of a long-winded, hard-working
locust. The waste land was an irregular
checkerboard of sand ridges and clumps of unhappy-looking
scrub trees. Men who jerked plows around
for a living certainly had saved themselves a lot of
grief and hardship by not stopping here. There
wasn’t a sign of a fence, which showed in itself that
the land wasn’t any good. Still, I concluded, it
must belong to some one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>Weary from watching us all day, and messing up
our faces with sweat, the sun, on its way to bed,
was fast sliding out of the sky in the west. From a
sizzling white moth ball it had changed itself into
a big orange. The air was cooler now, but the concrete
under our dragging feet seemed hotter than ever.
It was like walking on hot stove lids.</p>

<p>It was Poppy’s idea that the small town of New
Zion, where we were going to cross the river, was
just ahead of us, to the left, on a side road running
north and south, between C. H. O. (where we were)
and C. H. P. (where we wanted to be). But as we
trudged along the hard roadway no sign of church
steeples or shapely water towers came into sight.
I was about to let go in weak-kneed despair, when
suddenly the sound of an automobile cut the road
silence behind us.</p>

<p>“Hot dog!” I cried, with new pep. “The road’s
open! We won’t have to walk now.”</p>

<p>But instead of a string of cars coming toward us
from the direction of Pardyville, we could make out
just one moving shape. It was far down the sloping
road. Nor was the solitary car speeding toward
us, though from the noise it was making, and the
smoke, you could have imagined that it was scorching
along at double the law’s limit.</p>

<p>After an hour or two, more or less, the slow-moving,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
smoking car got close enough for us to see that it
was a roadster without a top. Maybe at one time
it had been a fairly good-looking car. But that was
years and years ago. In its old age it had gotten a
broken back, which left the front and rear ends
tipped up like the head and tail of a canoe. The
sides were open—there were no doors—which in
itself stamped the car as a relic. The windshield
had long ago shimmied itself to pieces, though the
brass frame that once had held the glass was still
there. All four wheels toed out, like the wheels of Dad’s
brickyard dump cart, and one front fender was gone.</p>

<p>There was an old man in the car—a queer-looking
old man, sort of stooped and thin-faced. He was
hanging to the steering wheel for dear life. I waved
to him to stop, but he didn’t seem to see us at all,
so deep was he in his driving job.</p>

<p>The crazy car having passed us, the noisiest piece
of junk that I ever had seen on the road, I untangled
myself from its smoky tail to find Poppy laughing
his head off.</p>

<p>“The Galloping Snail!” he yipped, having read
the name that was printed on the back of the car.</p>

<p>“It sure is a ‘Galloping Snail,’ all right. Why didn’t
you jump in, Jerry?—you’ve been yelling for a ride.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t want to cheat the goose out of its seat,”
I laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>“Goose?” says the other, looking at me.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you see the goose on the seat?”</p>

<p>“Who do you mean?—the old man?”</p>

<p>“No, a real goose.”</p>

<p>“I guess it was a pair of geese,” laughed Poppy,
thinking of the queer driver.</p>

<p>Sometimes a fellow gets a hunch about things
that he’s heading into. But we had no hunch that
we’d ever see that old car again, much less get mixed
up in a crazy, shivery adventure with its queer driver
and his equally queer gander—for it was a gander
that I had seen, as we learned later on, and not a
goose.</p>

<p>A spotted gander! Did you ever hear of one? No?
Well, you’re going to hear about one pretty soon.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

<small>A HOUSE OF MYSTERY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> though to completely take the joy out of life
for us, no other cars came along, as we had expected
they would. The sway-backed roadster with the
crazy name and queer-looking driver seemed to have
the whole highway to itself. And that was strange,
we thought, puzzled.</p>

<p>Why had the road been closed to all the cars except
this one? Or, to put it another way, if the road had
been closed to the general traffic, for certain reasons,
how had the one car gotten permission to come
through?</p>

<p>It was dusk now. And as though cheered up by
the cooler air of early nightfall, the crickets and locusts
were tuning it up to beat the cars. Or maybe, was
my crazy thought, they were hooting at us in derision
as we passed. I could imagine, as we trudged along,
hungry and fagged out, that we looked not unlike
some rare piece of junk that the cat had dragged in.
I know I felt that way.</p>

<p>Once or twice we caught sight of a scuttling rabbit.
And now that the bushes beside the hard road were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
lost in creeping shadows, I began to pick out moving
eyes. Hunks of green glass set close together.</p>

<p>Poppy had joked with me about putting in the
night here, though at the time neither of us had
thought that we might in all fact have to do that
very thing. But now the outlook was against us.
We seemed to be a million miles from nowhere. Did
snakes and sand lizards, I wondered, have green eyes?
Br-r-r-r! If it came about, to our further grief, that
we had no other choice than to stick it out all night
in the open, it was my clever little decision to roost
in a tree—that and nothing else but. I wasn’t so
well supplied with spare legs and arms that I cared
to run the chance of having one chawed off and
hurriedly digested by some green-eyed monster while
I snoozed on a bed of sand burs. I guess not.</p>

<p>Certainly, I checked up on the day’s adventures, so
different from our dreams, a fellow’s fortunes were
easily turned upsidedown. Only that morning we
had set forth on our trip with lilting hearts, as the
saying is. Everything was sunshine and chocolate
drops. But were we lilting now? Not so you could
notice it. I had the beaten feeling, as I dragged
myself along, that I had lilted my last lilt.</p>

<p>“Poppy,” I suffered, feeling that it was time for
some more nonsense, “if the worst comes to the
worst, and I go down first, you can have my jigsaw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
and football shoes—only the jigsaw needs a new
leather belt.”</p>

<p>“Merrily we roll along, roll along, roll along,”
the other sang, to cheer me up.</p>

<p>“Say, Poppy,” I breathed, clinging to his arm, my
eyes far away, “what is heaven like?”</p>

<p>“Be yourself, kid,” he shoved at me. “You
aren’t Little Eva.”</p>

<p>“I wish now that I had taken lessons on a harp,”
I tremoloed, “instead of a shoehorn. If only we
could look ahead and know what the Fates have in
store for us. Eh, kid?”</p>

<p>“Jerry,” came warmly, as the leader slipped an
arm around me, “you’re a regular little sunbeam.
For no matter how hard we get bumped, your stock
of silly gab never dries up. I don’t know how I ever
could get along without you. Certainly, it wouldn’t
be the same old world.”</p>

<p>Well, that was pretty nice of him, I thought. I
appreciated the hug, too!</p>

<p>“If you want to,” I puckered up, looking at him
with my soul in my eyes, “you can kiss your little
sunbeam ... once.”</p>

<p>“Go on!” he shoved.</p>

<p>I was about to unhinge some more of my crazy
gab, when all of a sudden the leader gave a whoop
and scooted down the road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>“Here’s a signboard, Jerry. ‘New Zion ten
miles,’” he read.</p>

<p>“Ten miles!” I groaned.</p>

<p>“We can make it.”</p>

<p>“But look at the road!” I wailed. “It’s nothing
but sand. We’ll slip back faster than we can go
ahead.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll walk backwards,” came the quick
grin.</p>

<p>“Ten miles!” I suffered anew. “It’s no use,
Poppy,” I waggled weakly, as a sort of climax to
my little act. “I’m done for. Remember, kid,
the jigsaw’s yours. And you’ll find my book of
patterns and seven new blades under the dog house.
Good-by, Poppy. You meant well in bringing
me here. But you didn’t know, old pal. So I
forgive you. And if you can’t make the jigsaw saw
ask Dad to help you, for he’s almost as clever at
sawing hunks out of his finger tips as I am.”</p>

<p>“I’ll ‘jigsaw’ you in the seat of the pants if you
don’t come on and shut up,” he told me.</p>

<p>Seesawing together, the moon had been lifted into
sight by the sinking sun. And now we could trace
the winding course of the sandy road leading to
New Zion. As I have hinted in an earlier paragraph,
it was <i>some</i> road. Sand to the right of us, sand to
the left of us and sand in front of us, as Lord Tennyson<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
would have written it in poetry. But as I trudged
along beside the leader I tried to grin and bear it.</p>

<p>“A light, Jerry!” he suddenly yipped. “There’s
a farmhouse up ahead of us. We’re saved now, old
kid.”</p>

<p>There was indeed a house up ahead of us, on the
right-hand side of the road. We could see it in the
moonlight. But as we hurried toward it, in livelier
spirits, I couldn’t make myself believe that it was a
farmhouse. Certainly, it was no ordinary farmhouse.
For it was much too showy. I could count three stories
and an attic. It was a stone house, too. And
even if it had been built years and years ago, when
labor and plaster were peddled around at bargain
rates, I could not doubt that it had cost a fortune.</p>

<p>Who had been crazy enough, I wondered, curious
over the unusual place, to build a house like this at
the very end of the world? It didn’t fit into the waste
landscape at all. Still, was my contented thought,
the better the house the better the meal. It ought
to work out that way. So we really were in luck
to strike a place like this instead of a shack, which
would have better matched the country.</p>

<p>Not only was the house itself built of stone, but
it was inclosed by a stone wall at least three feet
high. Where the private road turned in, smoothly
graveled, the wall was lifted into a huge arched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
gateway. Looking in, I thought curious-like of the
magic palace that the genii had built for Aladdin.</p>

<p>“Is it real?” I asked Poppy’s opinion, wondering if
it would be safe for us to go in. “Or is it a mirage,
as you read about in stories of people crossing the
desert?”</p>

<p>“Tell me what you see,” laughed the other, as
puzzled over the unusual place as I was, “and I’ll
tell you what I see.”</p>

<p>“A beautiful three-story stone house,” I checked
off, “with fancy jiggers all over it, to make it showy,
and a stone wall in front, with a big gateway, like a
cemetery.”</p>

<p>“That’s exactly what I see, too. So I guess it’s
real enough. But it beats me,” the puzzled leader
concluded, matching my thoughts, “to find a place like
this in a country where there aren’t even farmhouses.”</p>

<p>Leg weary and hollow under our belts, it had been
our intention to buy a meal here, late as it was, and
if possible rent a bed for the night. Certainly, done
up as we were from our first unsatisfactory day on the
road, it was all right for us to draw on our emergency
fund. The next night, when we were on the other
road where the automobiles were, and playing in
luck again, we would try working for our supper and
breakfast, as we had planned on doing. But not
to-night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>It struck me, though, as I stood there looking at
the peculiar house, that this was no place to buy a
meal. If we were admitted into the house at all it
would be without pay. For only a very wealthy
man could have built a place like this. And what
would a dollar or two of our money mean to him?</p>

<p>Still, unless we wanted the people to think that
we were tramps, it would be better for us to offer to
pay for our supper, I told Poppy, than to ask for it.
So of this determination we turned in through the
big gate and mounted the front steps.</p>

<p>The door that we came to was set in a framework
of glass, in the old colonial way, and taking a squint
inside, I saw a long, wide, dimly-lit hall, the walls
and ceiling of which were fixed up with fancy dark
wood panels. It was a swell house, all right, as swell
on the inside, with its beautiful walls and old furniture,
as it was on the outside. And more than ever
I wondered at its being here. It must have a queer
history, I told myself.</p>

<p>“Clang!” went the old-fashioned knocker. And
I stepped back now, out of sight, for a small, quick-footed
woman of considerable age had come briskly
into sight, carrying a hand lamp. I saw her set the
lamp on a small table close to the door. In her blue
and white kitchen apron, she didn’t look very high-toned,
like the big house, yet, to that point, I liked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
her best the way she was. She had a sort of motherly
look. Her gray hair was combed tight to her head,
which she carried very straight on her shoulders,
and even before I got a close look at her I knew that
her eyes were gray, too. I was to learn soon that
they were very bright eyes, sparkling as she talked—and
could she <i>talk</i>! Oh, boy!</p>

<p>The door was opened without hesitation. Yet at
sight of us the woman seemed to be startled, even
disappointed. She was looking for some one else,
I figured.</p>

<p>“It’s just two boys,” Poppy spoke up quickly,
noticing that the older one was trying to look over
our shoulders. “We haven’t had any supper. And
seeing your light, as we were hoofing it for New Zion,
we wondered if you wouldn’t be kind enough to sell
us something to eat.”</p>

<p>“Laws-a-me!” cried the little old woman, with
a nervous, excited gesture. “If you’ve got money,
keep it. You don’t have to pay for a meal in <i>this</i>
house, not while <i>I’m</i> here, though how long I’ll be
here I can’t say.”</p>

<p>“That’s fine,” says Poppy in good manners.
“But we don’t want to be cheap about it.”</p>

<p>“Samantha Ann <i>Danver</i> Doane is my name,” the
woman ran on, “<i>Danver</i> being my maiden name, and
a name I’m justly proud of, I want you to know.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
While it probably isn’t anything to boast of, and
certainly nothing to be ashamed of, I’ll confess to
you, as I have to other people, it being my nature to
be frank and open, that I’m only a poor relation of
the man who built this house and lived in it until his
sudden death, the ninth of last August. So now you
know who I am, and you understand what I mean
when I say I don’t know how long I’ll be here....
Who did you say you were?”</p>

<p>Poppy gave our names and explained about the
closed highway. All the time he was talking the
woman talked, too. It was kind of funny. But I
kept a straight face. For even if old people are
queer, you can’t laugh at them to their face. I
guess not. Mother and Dad would jerk me out of
my skin if I ever did a trick like that.</p>

<p>“When you first knocked,” the woman ran on,
and I was getting wise to her lively eyes now, “I
thought it was Miss Ruth. ‘There,’ says I to myself,
as I dropped my work in the kitchen, ‘it would be
just like that dear jolly girl to call me to the door
and then jump into my arms.’ While I am a poor
relation of the Danvers, as I say, I want you to know
that I’m very proud of my stock, and consequently
Miss Ruth is very dear to me, though I don’t like
her mother, and never did. The proud piece! But,
laws-a-me, Miss Ruth is the <i>dearest</i> girl, just about the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
age of you boys, and just like her pa and her grandpa,
too.”</p>

<p>Talk like that takes a lot of air. But in stopping
to get her wind, the little old lady didn’t waste any
time.</p>

<p>“<i>He</i> was the commonest and kindest man I ever
knew in all my life, with all of his great wealth—meaning
Mr. Corbin Danver, who built this mammoth
house and died here—and how his son, Harold,
could have quarreled with him, and let the quarrel
stand to the separation of the two branches of the
family, is more than <i>I</i> can figure out. But a lot of
queer things happen in this world—and in the best
of families, our own unexcepted.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” says Poppy, feeling, I guess, that
to be polite he ought to say something.</p>

<p>The woman then switched her thoughts to us and
smiled as though she had seen worse-looking guys.</p>

<p>“As I say, I didn’t expect to find two <i>boys</i> when I
opened the door, but you are none the less welcome,
if that is in good form as coming from a poor relation.
And you’re hungry, you say! Well, just come with
me to the kitchen and I’ll see what I can find for
you. I haven’t had supper myself, figuring I’d wait
until Pa and Miss Ruth got here, so I may take a bite
with you for company’s sake, for Pa may not get
here for another hour. <i>Such</i> an old car as we have!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
But it’s all we can afford. You never know what is
liable to happen to it when you start out. A wheel
ran off the day we came here, which was a week ago
yesterday. Oh, dear! It’s awful to be poor. I
sometimes wonder how it would seem to be a <i>rich</i>
relation for once instead of a <i>poor</i> relation.... Do
you like cold meat sandwiches? Or shall I fry some
potatoes?”</p>

<p>“Don’t go to any bother,” Poppy told her quickly.
“For anything in the way of grub is good enough
for us.”</p>

<p>Having followed the woman to the kitchen, we
now watched her, grinning at each other, while she
worked and talked. Her hands and tongue moved
together, though for the most part what she said
passed over our heads. She kept referring to “Miss
Ruth” and “Pa.” “Miss Ruth’s ma,” we learned,
had been a <i>Hardy</i> before her marriage into the
<i>Danver</i> family. And considering her stock she was
acting much too big for her shoes—whatever that
was. But “Miss Ruth’s pa” was a gentleman of
<i>real</i> stock—a <i>Danver</i>, if you please! And “Miss
Ruth” herself was just like her pa and her grandpa.</p>

<p>What interested us more than the woman’s chatter
was the fine supper that she set out for us. Boy,
did food ever taste so good to us! I’d be ashamed
to tell you how many sandwiches we ate. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
however much we stuffed ourselves, we didn’t eat
half enough to suit the little old lady, who, having
talked all the time she was getting the “eats” ready,
was still talking. Her one great ambition, it
seemed to me, was to tell all she knew!</p>

<p>Once she left us, to see if “Pa and Miss Ruth”
were coming. We heard her open the front door and
go outside.</p>

<p>“She sure has a limber tongue,” grinned Poppy,
murdering his tenth sandwich. “But she’s all right,”
he tacked on hastily, not wanting me to get a wrong
idea of what he meant.</p>

<p>“What do you make out of her talk?” says I,
looking around the big kitchen, which was as fine
a kitchen as I ever had been in.</p>

<p>“As I understand it, she and ‘Pa,’ her husband,
came here a week ago to open up this house, which
had been closed since the funeral—whoever it was
that died here.”</p>

<p>“I got that part—it was Miss Ruth’s grandfather,
Mr. Corbin Danver. He was the man who built
this place.”</p>

<p>“But who is Miss Ruth?”</p>

<p>“Some girl who’s coming here on a visit, I guess.”</p>

<p>“‘Pa’ went to the train to meet her, huh?”</p>

<p>“That’s the way I understand it.”</p>

<p>Poppy laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>“Say, Jerry, I wonder if that wasn’t ‘Pa’ in the
old car.”</p>

<p>“He was headed this way, all right.”</p>

<p>“Still,” the leader turned the thought around in
his mind, “it couldn’t have been him. For the man
who passed us in the Galloping Snail could easily
have gotten here ahead of us. Besides, he was alone.”</p>

<p>“Don’t forget about the goose,” I grinned.</p>

<p>“A goose isn’t a girl.”</p>

<p>“A lady goose is,” I joked, “when she’s young.”</p>

<p>“You’re a goose yourself!”</p>

<p>The woman was nervous when she came back to
the kitchen.</p>

<p>“Dear me!” she cried. “I’m beginning to worry
about Pa. For it’s almost ten o’clock. Do you
suppose he’s lost?”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t he know the roads around here?” I
inquired.</p>

<p>“<i>Him?</i> Pa is dumb, if I must admit it, as one
who has lived with him for more than forty years.
<i>He</i> isn’t a Danver,” came proudly, “it’s <i>me</i> who is.
<i>He’s</i> a Doane, and the Doanes, from Cyril Doane
down, are a thick-headed lot, though I hoped well for
Pa when I married him. But it’s a fact, <i>he</i> wouldn’t
know how to put on his shirt if I didn’t yank him
into it. However, he’s a good husband in some
ways. For one thing, he never talks back to me.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
But it’s <i>me</i> who has to do all the planning. His head
might just as well be made of wood for all the use
he makes of it. I never can depend on him. The
other day I sent him to Neponset Corners for some
<i>baking</i> powder and he ended up in Sandy Ridge
where he bought <i>bug</i> powder. Powder! That was
all he could keep in his mind at one time—he knew
I had said <i>powder</i>—but could he think of <i>baking</i>
powder?—no, <i>bug</i> powder! That’s Pa for you.
No wonder I worry about him when he’s out of my
sight. And I wish now that I hadn’t trusted him
to go to Pardyville alone.”</p>

<p>“We came through Pardyville this afternoon,”
says Poppy, by way of conversation.</p>

<p>“Like as not,” came the further worry, “he’ll
go to the wrong depot. Oh, dear! What wouldn’t
I give to hear one of his old tires blow up out in front—just
to know that he was home safe and sound.
Suppose something should happen to Miss Ruth!—and
her coming here secretly. What would her ma
say? I sometimes think she shouldn’t have planned
to come here without telling her ma. And to that
point, <i>why</i> she wants to come here, so secret-like,
is a mystery to <i>me</i>. But when I got her letter, asking
me to come over with Pa to open the house, I didn’t
say ‘no.’ That was little enough for a body to do
for one’s rich relation, I thought—and you always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
get something for it. As I said to Pa last night,
‘Pa, <i>why</i> is Miss Ruth so anxious to come here all
of a sudden? What is her object? Kept away from
her grandpa’s funeral by her ma, who never got
over the quarrel, is she anxious now to come here,
on her way to boarding school, out of respect for
the dead?’ But you might as well talk to a hitching
post as to talk to Pa. All <i>he</i> ever says is ‘yes’ and
‘no,’ and half the time he doesn’t know enough to
say that if I don’t tell him to.”</p>

<p>I was thinking to myself, sort of grinning-like,
that maybe all “Pa” ever had a chance to say was
“yes” and “no.” But, of course, I kept shut on
my thoughts. For I know my manners.</p>

<p>As we finished our supper, the droning voice of a
clock came down the stairs. I began to count the
slow strokes.</p>

<p>“Listen!” the woman breathed, and I saw that
a quick change had come over her. She looked
frightened—as though she expected something to
rush in and grab her. “... seven ... eight ... nine
... ten,” she counted. There was a short deep
silence. Then something slammed upstairs. “What
is it?” she cried, looking back and forth at us.</p>

<p>“Sounded like a door,” says Poppy.</p>

<p>“I know it’s a door. And I suspect that it’s the
door of the chamber where Miss Ruth’s grandpa<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
died. But what makes it <i>slam</i>? And always when
the clock strikes ten! It does that every night.
As I told Pa the second time it happened, there’s
something queer going on in this house—something
that neither he nor I can understand. Miss Ruth
isn’t coming here in a mere whim. She has a <i>reason</i>.
Has she learned why her grandpa left her the keys
of this house? Does she know what is in the will,
which is to be read here Wednesday night? Certainly,
when she gets here, and I expect her any
minute now, I hope that she tells me the truth.
For if there’s anything I hate it’s to be around people
who have secrets. <i>Me?</i>—I never had a secret in all
my life. I don’t believe in secrets. And that is
one reason why I set my foot down when Pa wanted
to join the Masons. I wasn’t going to have <i>him</i>
know things that <i>I</i> didn’t know.”</p>

<p>Poppy was sitting beside the telephone. And when
it suddenly jingled he jumped as though he had
been shot.</p>

<p>“Laws-a-me!” cried the woman nervously. “I
wonder what now?”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

<small>THE SPOTTED GANDER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> ghost theory is bunk. Every big kid knows
that. <i>Ghosts?</i> Pooh! Who could be crazy enough
to believe in ghosts? That is what we say back and
forth, the <i>big</i> kids I mean, when the sun is doing its
dinner-time stuff, high in the sky, and the nearest
cemetery is six miles away.</p>

<p>But what happens when a white cow makes goo-goo
eyes at us over a moonlit cemetery fence? Oh, boy!
How we can cut the dust then. The only kid who
ever beat me in a race like that was Spider Whickleberry,
and his legs are so long that he modestly uses
his pa’s white duck trousers for basketball pants.
And even then the pants aren’t any too long for him!</p>

<p><i>Me</i> believe in ghosts? Well, I should sa-ay not!
But, to own up, what was the big thought in my
mind right now? <i>Ghosts</i>, and nothing else but.
Yes, sir, as crazy as it may seem to you, I actually
believed in my excitement that there <i>was</i> a ghost in
the upper part of the house. And what more likely
than the ghost of the man who had died here?</p>

<p>At first sight the lonely house had struck me as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
being queer. Not only in its unusual size, as it had
towered in the moonlight, but in its desolate location,
as well. Truly, had been my thought, no one but a
queer-minded man could have wanted such a place.</p>

<p>Now I wondered if the dead man’s secrets were
living after him. It would seem so. Br-r-r-r!
Certainly, I told myself, the elderly spook had a nice
gentle way of letting us know that it was on the job!
I wondered further if the door slamming, so sharp
and businesslike, wasn’t a gentle little hint for us to
evaporate.</p>

<p>But the leader just laughed at me when I told him
my thoughts. There was no such thing as ghosts,
he argued. When people were dead they were dead—and
once buried in the regular way that was the end of
them so far as their earthly stunts were concerned.</p>

<p>“I’d sooner think,” says he, “that it’s tramps.”</p>

<p>“Tramps?” says I.</p>

<p>“Sure thing. They’ve had the house to themselves
since it was closed. See? And the door slamming is
a trick of theirs to scare the old people away.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Doane came away from the telephone with
flashing eyes. It was Lawyer Chew of Neponset
Corners, she told us, and we remembered then that
Neponset Corners was the small town across the
river from New Zion, on the other hard road where
the automobiles were.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>“He practically ordered me to leave here,” the
indignant talker galloped along, “but until Miss Ruth
<i>herself</i> tells me to get out I’m going to stay right ...
where ... I ... am. The idea of <i>him</i>, whose grandfather
was jailed for horse stealing, and, worse,
almost lynched, ordering a <i>Danver</i> around! My
blood boils. Oh, the burden and humiliation of being
a poor relation! But let him try to order Miss
Ruth out of here and very probably she’ll tell him
what <i>I</i> hardly dared to tell him. For this is her
house, though, of course, to a legal fine-point, she
hasn’t a deed to it <i>yet</i>. But everybody in the family
knows that her grandpa left her the keys, and certainly,
as I tell Pa, when we speculate on what <i>we</i>
are likely to get, the old gentleman wouldn’t have
ordered the keys turned over to her when he was
dead and gone if he didn’t consider the place hers.
Yet, even if she does inherit it—and we’ll know the
truth in a day or two, when the will is read—what
good will she get out of it? For who besides a
recluse like Corbin Danver would want to live in
a place like this?”</p>

<p>“It certainly is lonely enough,” says Poppy.</p>

<p>“Still,” the woman added quickly, “<i>I</i> would
gladly take it if it were given to <i>me</i>. Yes, indeed.
But I’m not Miss Ruth. While <i>I</i> could live here if
necessary, it would bore her to death, for she loves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
gayety and excitement. And what is there gay and
exciting around <i>here</i>? Even the nearest town is a
community of religious fanatics, who won’t look at a
talking machine or an automobile. Anything that
isn’t plain bread and butter and hard work is a
worldly sin in their eyes.”</p>

<p>“She means New Zion,” Poppy nudged me.</p>

<p>“Of course, as I tell Pa, I haven’t any hopes of
getting this place, being no closer kin than a cousin.
In fact, to that point, I haven’t the slightest idea
what I will get. I tried to pump Lawyer Chew the
day of the funeral, for, of course, he knows what is
in the will, being the family lawyer. But could I
get anything out of <i>him</i>? No, indeed! Nor did
any of the other relations, I venture to say. The
seal of the will, he explained importantly—and if
there’s anything I hate next to secrecy it’s over-importance!—was
not to be broken for a year. I
remember my feelings that day. In his lifetime
Corbin Danver had been a deep man. Always
thinking and scheming. I could tell you some very
unusual stories about him. And knowing him so
well, I realized that he had acted to a hidden purpose,
both in giving his granddaughter the keys of his
house and letting his will stand unread for a year.
Yet, puzzle my brain as I would, I could think of
no answer to the riddle. Nor did I, as I say, get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
any help from Mr. Tight-mouth Chew! I was to
have patience, he told me dryly. In due time I
would learn if <i>my</i> name were mentioned in the will.”</p>

<p>We were grinning now.</p>

<p>“Humph! I only hope, if Miss Ruth does inherit
the bulk of the estate, as she has a right to do, that
she gives that impudent-acting lawyer his walking
papers. It rather surprised him, I think,” and by a
warmer look in her eyes, and a wag of her head, the
talker showed satisfaction now, “to learn that the
granddaughter had sent me here to open up the house
for her. He hadn’t much to say after I told him
that. Maybe, though, I shouldn’t have mentioned
it. For Miss Ruth said I was to come here quietly.
Yet how was I going to explain my presence here
except by telling him the truth?”</p>

<p>“Say, Mrs. Doane,” Poppy jumped in, when the
long-distance talker put on the air brakes and stopped.
“Jerry and I think we know what made that door
slam.”</p>

<p>The woman’s jaw dropped, showing her false
teeth, and for an instant she looked blank.</p>

<p>“The door!” she cried. Then she was herself
again. “Laws-a-me!” and she started off at her
usual snappy pace. “With Lawyer Chew trying
to chase me out of here, I had forgotten all about
the door.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>“Had you thought of tramps, Mrs. Doane?”</p>

<p>“Tramps? I’d sooner think it was spooks,” came
bluntly.</p>

<p>“Atta-boy!” I yipped. “That’s exactly what <i>I</i>
thought, too.”</p>

<p>“But, Mrs. Doane,” argued old material mind,
“there is no such thing as a real spook.”</p>

<p>“No?” came quietly, and the peculiar dry smile
that jumped into the woman’s face, and out again,
showed that she was holding something back. “Maybe,”
she added, unable, I guess, to longer keep her
secret, “if you knew <i>everything</i> that has happened
in this house since Pa and I came here you’d change
your mind about spooks. I know <i>I</i> have. Doors
slamming, footfalls in the dead of night, windows
creaking in their slides, and every night that <i>queer
smell</i> in the upper hall.”</p>

<p>Poppy was staring now.</p>

<p>“Queer smell?” he used her words. “What do
you mean?”</p>

<p>“When we first came here,” the housekeeper ran
on, only too glad of the chance, I guess, to tell her
unusual story, “I thought I detected a peculiar smell
in the house. Like drugs. But it seemed to go away
when we let in fresh air. Then that night the door
slammed. Pa and I had gone to bed. We got up,
thinking that a window was open. But we could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
find no open windows. And in the hall I noticed
that peculiar smell again, only stronger. I asked Pa
if he noticed it. ‘A dead rat,’ says he. ‘No,’ says
I sharply, ‘it isn’t a dead rat—it’s some kind of a
drug.’ Well, we went back to bed again, finding
everything all right, as I say. Then the next night
the door slammed again. And there in the hall was
that same peculiar smell. The third night Pa and I
watched. But first we went around and locked all
the doors. Yet at ten o’clock we heard the sound
again. And trying the doors, we found that the
one leading into the master’s chamber was unlocked.”</p>

<p>“And you’re sure you locked it?”</p>

<p>“I had told <i>Pa</i> to lock it, but, as I say, you’re
never sure of anything <i>he</i> does. The fourth night,
though, <i>I</i> locked the door myself.”</p>

<p>“And what happened?”</p>

<p>“We later found it wide open. And again that
peculiar smell hung in the hall. Since then Pa and
I have been locking ourselves in our room. Yet I
never get to sleep until after ten o’clock. And always
at the same hour, when the clock has struck ten, I
hear the door slam. The last two nights we’ve
heard other things, too—the creaking of windows,
as I say, and even footfalls.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be jiggered!” cried Poppy; then he got my
eyes to see if I were as struck with excitement as he was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>“<i>Pa</i> always did believe in ghosts and the like,”
the little old woman ran on, determined to tell all
she knew. “But <i>me</i>—it was a parcel of nonsense,
I said. But now what can I say? I don’t know how
much of the situation you’ve grasped from my talk—and
I guess, if the truth is told, I <i>do</i> talk an awful
lot—still, I’m not ashamed of that trait, for it’s characteristic
of the women on our side of the house.
There was my Aunt Samantha, for whom I was
named. <i>She</i> was a real talker, to my notion. Laws-a-me!
How I enjoyed my visits with her before she
got paralysis of the jaw. As I say, I don’t know how
much of my talk you remember, rambling as it is,
but I have tried to make you understand that <i>something
queer</i> is going on in this house. You say it’s
tramps. I don’t believe it. For listen to this,”
and the voice was mysteriously lowered. “When
Corbin Danver died,” came slowly, “<i>I</i> was the first
blood relative to get here. I wanted to have a
final look at him, before the others came, to see if
the undertaker had removed the two ugly warts on
his nose, as was proper, I thought, but Dr. Madden,
who since has been in Europe, said ‘no.’ He had
reasons, he declared, more important than warts,
for keeping the casket closed. This, coming on top
of the old gentleman’s unusually sudden death,
aroused my suspicions. And being of a determined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
nature—another Danver trait—I decided to see for
myself. Nor did I even take Pa into my confidence.
That night at twelve o’clock, with everybody else
asleep, I crept downstairs.... I was sickened for a
moment by a strangling odor.... You can see what
I’m leading up to—every night since we have been
here, at ten o’clock, the hour my relative died, that
same smell seeps through the upper hall. A peculiar
drug. I can’t name it. And however much I have
scolded Pa in the past about his silly belief in spirits,
I now find myself wondering if the body of Corbin
Danver, saturated with that drug, is indeed coming
back in spirit form. And to what purpose? Has
he some message for me?—some instructions? If so,
why doesn’t he come to me directly instead of slamming
the door of his bedchamber night after night?
And there is Miss Ruth. <i>Why</i> is she coming here
secretly? Some one must have sent for her. But
who? And now, in final, I have Lawyer Chew’s
ultimatum to get out of here promptly before the
law puts me out. Oh,” and the woman threw up
her thin hands, a hopeless look taking hold of her
tired face, “it seems to me that a hundred things
have happened since I came here to unnerve and
bewilder me. And how glad I am to have you boys
to talk to, you can’t imagine. I think I would go
crazy if I had to be here alone very many hours.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>Poppy got around so he could whisper to me.</p>

<p>“Do you believe her story, Jerry?”</p>

<p>“Sure thing. Don’t you?”</p>

<p>“She may be cuckoo.”</p>

<p>“You’re cuckoo!”</p>

<p>His eyes began to dance.</p>

<p>“Oh, boy, if only we could sleep in the room where
the old man died! The ‘ghost’ would get the surprise
of his life, huh, when we yanked his sheet off?”</p>

<p>“I don’t like it,” I told him. But I wasn’t scared.
No. Ready to stand by him, as a loyal chum should,
what worried me, I guess, was the thought that I
might not be gritty enough to do my part in some
of the crazy situations that were sure to bob up if
we started any of the “ghost-catching” business.
For “ghost-catching,” let me tell you,
even when the “ghost” is a man and not a real
spook, is a mighty risky game, and nothing else but.</p>

<p>I’ll never forget our first trip into the upper rooms
of the big house. At every step I expected something
to grab me. We went up the big front staircase,
through all the rooms, one after another, where
we looked under the beds and in the closets, then
down the smaller back stairs. We went through the
attic, too, finding all kinds of trash there.</p>

<p>Poppy’s “tramp” theory exploded into thin air,
we landed back in the kitchen at ten-thirty, having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
used the small back staircase in coming down, as I
say. Suddenly a fearful clatter came from the road.</p>

<p>“Listen!” cried the leader. Then he laughed.
“Does it sound familiar to you, Jerry?”</p>

<p>“The Galloping Snail!” I yipped, scooting for the
front door. Nor was I surprised to learn, after all,
that the man we had seen on the road was the one
this woman was watching for. Her talk about their
“poor automobile” had put me wise, though it
was a puzzle to me where the man had been all this
time.</p>

<p>“It’s Pa and Miss Ruth!” the woman cried, taking
after us. “They’ve come at last.”</p>

<p>Suddenly all sounds of the car ceased. And that
was queer, we thought. Running down the moonlit
graveled drive, we found the car on its side just outside
the stone arch, where the driver, in poor work,
had tried to swing out of the sandy ruts.</p>

<p>Thrown from the car, and getting his head cut,
the old man was sort of staggering around like a
groggy sailor. Then, before we could get to him,
he keeled over in a dead faint.</p>

<p>“He’s hurt!” the woman cried, and though, with
her white face, she looked as though she were going
to keel over herself, she kept up. “Help me, and
we’ll carry him into the house.”</p>

<p>Poppy wiped away the blood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>“It isn’t a deep cut, Mrs. Doane. He’ll be all
right in a minute or two.”</p>

<p>It was then, I think, that the woman discovered
that the car had brought only one passenger.</p>

<p>“Why!...” she cried in new alarm. “Where is
Miss Ruth?”</p>

<p>The injured man began to mumble like one in a
dream.</p>

<p>“Ma! Is that you, Ma?” and a fumbling hand
felt around in the air.</p>

<p>“Pa, what have you done with Miss Ruth? Where
is she?”</p>

<p>“Miss Ruth?” came vaguely.</p>

<p>“You went to the train to meet her. Where is
she?”</p>

<p>“Miss Ruth?” the voice faltered, as its groggy
owner, now sitting up, tried to explore his clogged
mind for the truth. “Did—did I—I see Miss Ruth,
Ma? I’ve plum furgot. It seems to me I did; an’
then it seems to me I didn’t. Now, Ma,” came whiningly,
like a little kid begging off, “please don’t scold.
You always scold. I guess I’ve furgot somethin’ ag’in.
I’m always furgittin’ somethin’ or other. But I’ll
go back an’ git it, if you’ll jest tell me what ’twas.”</p>

<p>The woman’s anger got the best of her sympathy.</p>

<p>“Ivor Doane! If you aren’t the dumbest numskull
I ever heard tell of.” Then she seemed to go to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
pieces. “Oh, dear!” she wailed, turning to us for
help. “Do you suppose he has lost Miss Ruth
somewhere along the road? What shall I do?
What shall I do?”</p>

<p>Suddenly I felt something nip the calf of my leg.
Boy, did I ever jump. And when I looked down,
there was the injured man’s goose. It was wanting
attention, I guess!</p>

<p>“The goose! The goose!” I yipped like a dumb-bell.</p>

<p>But Poppy had better eyes than me.</p>

<p>“It isn’t a goose, Jerry,” he told me quickly.
“It’s a spotted gander.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

<small>ADMIRAL PEPPER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> mystery that hung over the big stone house,
like a bat’s shadow, was a strange tangle. We could
see that, all right. And now, to help things along
to even greater mystery, had come the disappearance
of the granddaughter.</p>

<p>Was there, we wondered, some hidden tie-up
between the girl’s disappearance and the unusual
gander? We looked to the old man for an answer
to that, but he could tell us nothing. The more we
questioned him, when we got him in the house, the
dumber he acted. Had he seen the granddaughter
in Pardyville? He didn’t know—he <i>guessed</i> he
had one minute, and the next minute he <i>guessed</i>
he hadn’t. Nor could he tell us where he had gotten
the gander, which we had left on the front porch.</p>

<p>Another thing—the old man had passed us in his
rickety car at six-thirty, headed for home. Yet we
had beat him here by at least three hours. Where
had he been in that three hours? When we asked him,
he just stared at us. Where had he <i>been</i>? Why,
he had <i>been</i> on the road headed for home, of course.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
But we knew better. He had <i>been</i> some place else
... to more mystery! Instead of turning to the left
at the sandy crossroad, where we had turned, he
had kept on down the concrete. But why? What
had taken him past the turn? Where had he been?
Finding it did no good to question him, we gave up,
hopeful that his head would clear up over night.</p>

<p>After the long day, with its ups and downs, Mrs.
Doane was done up, as her face showed. But it
would do her no good to go to bed, she told us, nodding
wearily. For how could she sleep with the awful
picture in her mind of the missing granddaughter
lying unconscious beside the deserted concrete highway?</p>

<p>“She could have jounced out of the car and Pa
never would have missed her. That’s <i>him</i>. Oh,
at times I feel as though I could take him and shake
his pants off. He isn’t foolish—don’t deceive yourself
on that point. He’s just naturally <i>dumb</i>.”</p>

<p>“Now, Ma—” came whiningly, as the blank-eyed
old man pottered around the kitchen, feeling of his
head as though it was some connected part of him
that he had just discovered.</p>

<p>“Keep still!” came the impatient command. “I’m
disgusted with you.”</p>

<p>“Please, Ma—”</p>

<p>“And quit rattling your teeth,” was the further<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
command. “For that’s the way you chipped them
last Christmas. And goodness knows we haven’t
any money to fool away on unnecessary dentist bills.”</p>

<p>Poppy and I were grinning. Maybe it wasn’t the
best of manners, but we couldn’t hold in.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” the woman went on in misery, sort
of wringing her hands. “What wouldn’t I give to
know at this minute where Miss Ruth is. I’ll
forever feel guilty if any harm has befallen her
through Pa’s stupidity.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” Poppy spoke up, “he missed her in
Pardyville.”</p>

<p>“But where did he get that gander? And why
hasn’t she followed him in a rented car?”</p>

<p>“The road’s closed.”</p>

<p>“But <i>he</i> got through. And there’s the telephone.
If Miss Ruth is in Pardyville, and can’t get here
except on the south road through Neponset Corners
and New Zion, why doesn’t she telephone? She
might know I would worry until I <i>did</i> hear from her.”</p>

<p>“Hot dog!” cried Poppy. “That’s an idea. Why
don’t <i>you</i> telephone, Mrs. Doane? You can call
up the Pardyville depot. See? And the garages,
too. You ought to get track of the girl in that way.”</p>

<p>The woman was too much worked up to use the
telephone herself, so we did the job for her. But to
no success. The night operator hadn’t been at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
depot when the Chicago train came in—we’d have
to talk with the day operator, he said. There was
no one registered at either of the two hotels by the
name of Miss Ruth Danver. Nor had any of the
garages, or the taxicab company, been approached
by a girl of that name, or for that matter any girl
of any name, wanting to go into the country.</p>

<p>Our failure to get good news over the telephone
completely upset the woman.</p>

<p>“What will Miss Ruth’s ma say?” she cried. “Oh,
dear! Oh, dear!”</p>

<p>Poppy remembered that the granddaughter had
planned to come here on the sly.</p>

<p>“If I were you,” he advised, “I’d wait a day or
two before I telephoned to the mother. For you
don’t know as yet that anything really has happened
to the girl. She may have hired a private car to
drive her here.”</p>

<p>“Sure thing,” I put in, wanting to make the
woman feel better. “We may hear her drive in any
minute.”</p>

<p>The old man was still pottering around the room.</p>

<p>“Ma, did I have my supper? I—I jest kain’t
remember. One minute it seems to me I <i>did</i>. An’
the next minute it seems to me I <i>didn’t</i>.”</p>

<p>“Laws-a-me!” came kindly, showing that the
woman didn’t make a habit of jumping on the dumb<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
old man all the time. “Of course you haven’t had
supper, Pa. And you must be pretty nearly starved,
too. So come over here to the table right away.
The boys ate all the sandwiches, but I guess I can
make some more for you.”</p>

<p>Poppy and I were sort of silent during the sandwich
making, each doing stuff in his own mind. Nor
did the woman talk as much as usual. Maybe her
tongue was tired. I wondered if it wasn’t!</p>

<p>“Jerry,” the leader said at length, “do you know
what we ought to do?”</p>

<p>“What?” says I, hoping that he would stick to
schemes that weren’t too blamed risky. Ghost-catching
was my limit. Absolutely. Anything beyond
that I’d balk at.</p>

<p>“If the girl isn’t here by morning I think we ought
to go to Pardyville and look her up. We’ve got time.
And to tell the truth I’d like to talk with her and
get at the bottom of this mystery.”</p>

<p>“I’ll let you be the hero and rescue the fair damsel
in distress,” I grinned, feeling kind of silly. “For
you’re the best lady killer of the two.”</p>

<p>“I’m serious.”</p>

<p>“A fellow <i>should</i> be serious,” was my further nonsense,
“when he gets ready to fall in love.”</p>

<p>“You poor fish!”</p>

<p>I sort of brushed myself off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>“I wish now I’d worn my red necktie,” I primped.
“I might have stood a better chance.”</p>

<p>“What you need is a <i>green</i> necktie,” he fired at me.</p>

<p>“Jealousy!”</p>

<p>“Are you with me, Jerry?”</p>

<p>“Sure thing I’ll stand up with you,” I purposely
tangled up his meaning. “What do you call it?—the
best man, huh?”</p>

<p>“I mean, will you go back to Pardyville if I do?”</p>

<p>“Kid, I’d go to the North Pole, if you led the way—but
that’s a blamed co-old place, <i>I</i> think, for a
honeymoon.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you dumb-dora!” he gave up in despair.</p>

<p>“Say, Poppy,” I snickered, “look at old Ivory
Dome. He’s scratching his sandwich and sprinkling
pepper on his bald head.”</p>

<p>“Ivory Dome!” the other laughed, thinking, I
guess, that I was pretty clever. “Ivor Doane—Ivory
Dome! That’s a good one. He’s an ‘Ivory Dome,’
all right.”</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a wild volcanic eruption at
the table. Over went the pitcher of water and the
spoon holder. There was water and spoons all over
the kitchen floor.</p>

<p>“For land’s sake!” cried the housekeeper, grabbing
a sandwich out of the air. “Pa, I ought to take a
stick to you. Just look at my clean floor!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>“Ker-r-<i>choo</i>!” exploded the volcano anew. “Ker-r-CHOO!”</p>

<p>“Stop it!” as the table rocked more madly than
ever. Then by quick work the housekeeper saved
the sugar bowl.</p>

<p>“I—I—ker-r-<i>choo</i>! I kain’t stop it—<i>KER-R</i>-CHOO-O-O!”</p>

<p>“He sprinkled pepper on his head instead of the
sandwich,” grinned Poppy.</p>

<p>“Laws-a-me! That isn’t anything surprising for
<i>him</i>. One time he put a bunion plaster on his jaw
and cleaned his toes with the tooth brush.”</p>

<p>Having lived through the eruption, the old man
was staring now, as though the sneezing and its
cause had jarred loose some corner of his memory.</p>

<p>“Pepper,” came in a mumbling, unsteady voice.
“Pepper. <i>Admiral Pepper.</i> That’s it.”</p>

<p><i>Admiral Pepper!</i> What crazy thing was he talking
about? It was our turn to stare now.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a faint tap! ... tap! ... tap! ...
on the outside kitchen door. And scared out
of her wits, Mrs. Doane ran screaming into another
room.</p>

<p>“Who is it?” says the leader, tiptoeing to the door,
his right ear shoved out ahead to catch every possible
sound.</p>

<p>Tap! ... tap! ... tap!... That was the only answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>Well, I don’t mind telling you that this was another
moment in my life when I didn’t have to overwork
my imagination to believe in ghosts. I guess not.
The thing that was doing the tapping, I told myself,
was a ghost, probably a long, lean, hungry-looking
ghost with two or three hideous heads, and nothing
else but.</p>

<p>Then, as though unlatched by some unseen hand,
the door swung open. A gust of wind swept in.
And in walked—not a three-headed ghost—but that
blamed spotted gander!</p>

<p>“Why—why,” fumbled the old man, acting sort
of tickled as he got his eyes on the gander. “It’s
jest Mr. Pepper. I mean Mr. Salt an’ Pepper. No,
I mean—I mean—Now,” came blankly, as the feeble
brain got completely tangled up, “what <i>do</i> I mean,
anyway?”</p>

<p>“I guess,” supplied Poppy, staring at the flat-footed
newcomer, “you mean <i>Admiral</i> Pepper.”</p>

<p>“Admiral Pepper!” the wrinkled face cleared up.
“That’s it. That’s it.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br>

<small>THE MAN IN THE STORM</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Admiral Pepper</span>! That was some fancy handle,
I thought, for a gander. But I saw right off that it
was no ordinary gander. So the name was all right.</p>

<p>White, like most ganders, though peculiarly marked
with small purple spots, it was the biggest fowl of its
kind that I ever had seen. Standing on its webbed
feet, which reminded me of a pair of palm-leaf fans,
its tonneau, as we used to call the rear end of an
automobile, sort of dragged behind like an overloaded
dump cart. Of course, like all big geese, it
waddled when it walked. Yet it had dignity in
its waddle. A fat king, you know, would waddle
much more becomingly than a fat junk peddler!
There was further dignity in the way it held its big
head—carriage, I guess you’d call it. It seemed
to have no fear of us. To the contrary, in its lordly
possession of the house, it sort of acted as though we
ought to consider ourselves lucky that we weren’t
boosted outside along with the other unimportant
rubbish!</p>

<p>I’ve seen people act like that. Stuck-ups. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
sort of strut around as though they’re the whole
cheese, smell and all. The other human beings in the
landscape aren’t even presentable scenery. So my
conclusion was that Admiral Pepper, as the saying is,
belonged to the aristocracy—the gander-land aristocracy,
if you please!</p>

<p>Unlike the ordinary barnyard variety of geese,
this one didn’t honk its horn at us, nor did it do any
long-necked hissing stuff. Its dignity was too
strong. And to that point, having already mentioned
a king, can you imagine a ruler, on his grand entrance
into the official throne room, yipping to his subjects
to stand back and not get any shoe blacking on his
long velvet train! Hardly! You see what I mean,
I guess.</p>

<p>One time we had a rather strange adventure with
a performing hen. I told about that in detail in
another book, JERRY TODD AND THE WALTZING
HEN. Now I wondered if the gander, like
Isadora, the waltzing hen, hadn’t been brought up
for the most part, and to a purpose, in a circus.
Plainly, it was a pet. It showed in its actions that
it was used to living with people instead of birds of
its kind. Moreover, it expected special attention,
which further went to prove that whoever had owned
it had been in the habit of making a big fuss over it.
Could it do circus tricks? I wondered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>Recalling Isadora, the thought then jumped into
my head that it would be wise for us, if the granddaughter
didn’t show up, to inquire in Pardyville
if an animal show had stopped there recently. If so,
that would sort of explain the old man’s possession
of the unusual bird. To some crazy purpose it
could have followed him out of the show tent, or,
to his discredit, he could have stolen it. Certainly,
familiar as he was with its name, he must know where
it came from. He had the stuff in his head to tell us.
The trouble was his memory was like a locked door—he
couldn’t open it until he found the key.</p>

<p>Well, to pick up my story, we shut the kitchen
door, convinced now that the wind had opened it.
It was queer, of course, that the latch had slipped just
when the gander wanted to come in. But that was
nothing. Very probably the visitor, hearing us
inside, had been waiting at the door for some time,
hoping for a chance to get in. And wise to the
growing wind and darkened moon, which meant a
summer storm, it had done its tap! ... tap! ...
tap! ... stuff, to get shelter, just when the wind
was strong enough to spring the loose latch.</p>

<p>Taking a sort of shine to the unusual gander, with
all of its stuck-up ways, Poppy and I would have
made it comfortable for the night in the kitchen, if
we had been boss. But the thought of keeping a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
gander in the house, even though it was an unusual
gander, and probably house broken, was too much
for Mrs. Doane. You should have heard her explode
when we suggested it!</p>

<p>“Laws-a-me!” she stiffly turned us down, getting
a broom to drive the intruder away. “Why don’t
you think next of turning the house into a pigsty?
If you’re so deeply concerned over the gander’s
comfort, there’s a barn out back. Certainly, it
isn’t going to roost <i>here</i>. Imagine what Corbin
Danver would say, could he speak from the grave, to
have his kitchen turned into a gander roost. Just
<i>imagine</i>!”</p>

<p>The moon was gone now, as I say. The sky was
black with tumbling storm clouds. And on the way
to the barn, where we fastened the gander in for the
night, Poppy and I used a flashlight. What a quick
change, I thought, from early evening. The moon
had been full of light then. Now the whole world
was smothered under a heavy black blanket.</p>

<p>I don’t mind summer storms as a rule. The lightning
never scares me. For I have a sort of feeling
that God makes the lightning. And certainly, with
me taking up the Sunday-school collection week
after week, and never hooking a penny, but cheerfully
giving instead, He wouldn’t want to jab the deadly
lightning at me. That wouldn’t be right. When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
you’re good you expect to be used good. No, even
if the lightning is close by, I have a sort of steady
confidence that no harm will come to me. The
thunder, of course, makes a fellow jump, especially
if he’s half asleep. But a few jumps more or less
isn’t anything. As for the rain, I love to hear it—when
I’m in bed, I mean. Some rainy nights when
it isn’t too hot I sleep in the attic, just to hear the
patter! patter! on the roof. Music like that brings
out all the peace that there is inside of a fellow, I
want to tell you.</p>

<p>But to-night I seemed sort of unprotected in the
growing storm. I felt as though certain <i>black</i> scheming
things that God’s moonlight had kept away were
creeping in to an evil purpose. Couple up a slashing,
pounding storm with this mysterious house, I thought,
and there was no telling what wasn’t liable to happen.</p>

<p>Returning to the house, after taking care of the
gander, we heard Mrs. Doane putting her thick-headed
husband to bed on the second floor. Earlier
in the evening she had pointed out a room for us—though
not the room that Poppy had hoped for!—and
as it was long past our own bedtime, as well
as the old man’s, we locked the lower doors and
lighted our way up the back staircase with a small
hand lamp.</p>

<p>Outside, the wind was swishing around the corners<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
of the house to beat the cars. And a giant, or so it
seemed to me in crazy fancy, was slinging sand at the
windows by the scoop full. Boy, was I ever glad
now that I was inside, and not out there!</p>

<p>Pretty soon the rain came. Not an ordinary
rain, but a sort of mixed up cyclone and cloudburst.
It was <i>some</i> storm, let me tell you. I never hope to
see a worse one. Looking down on the yard, in the
lightning flashes, I could see a big lake. The sand
had turned into water.</p>

<p>“Well,” grinned Poppy, as he slid out of his clothes,
“I wonder what the program is for to-night.”</p>

<p>He was thinking about the ghost, of course.</p>

<p>“Maybe we ought to take turns staying awake,”
says I.</p>

<p>“Nix. We want the ghost to come. And it won’t
come if we aren’t asleep.”</p>

<p>“Just back up,” I fired at him, fishing my nightie
out of the little bag that held my truck—an extra
shirt, tooth brush, and things like that—“if you
think that little sugar plum is going to let old spooky
foot catch him asleep.”</p>

<p>“The ghost isn’t going to catch <i>us</i>—we’re going to
catch <i>it</i>.”</p>

<p>“‘It’ or ‘him,’ which?”</p>

<p>“It’s a ‘him,’ all right.... I wonder who
it is.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span><i>Bang!</i> went a bucket of water against the window.</p>

<p>“Some storm!” I cried.</p>

<p>“A <i>queer smell</i>,” mused Poppy, recalling the
housekeeper’s story, “footsteps in the dead of night,
windows creaking in their slides.” Then he laughed.
“I hope that the spook, whoever he is, puts on the
whole show to-night.”</p>

<p>“Lock the door,” says I, “and push the dresser
in front of it.”</p>

<p>“Cuckoo! We’d stand a fine chance of catching
the ghost if we locked ourselves in. Do you suppose
he’s going to smash the house down to get at us?”</p>

<p>“Then we aren’t going to lock the door?”</p>

<p>“Absolutely not.”</p>

<p>“That being the case,” I grinned, making a dive
for the bed, “I know who’s going to sleep next to
the wall.”</p>

<p>Settled cozily in bed, Poppy then began at the
beginning of the mystery, as we understood it, and
went over it step by step, the better, I guess, to sort
of figure out what was liable to happen to us if we
took a notion to work on it!</p>

<p>And listening, I became sort of fascinated. I
thought of other mysteries that we had solved—the
talking frog, the rose-colored cat, the Oak-Island
treasure, the whispering mummy, the stuttering
parrot. What a wonderful chance this was, I told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
myself, all worked up, for a clever little Juvenile
Jupiter Detective to show his stuff.</p>

<p>First of all, in Poppy’s check-up, came the strange
house itself. Why had it been built here? Or, to
put the question another way, what had been Mr.
Danver’s hidden purpose in building it here—a fifty-thousand-dollar
mansion on a ten-cent farm? Was
it to be alone? Possibly. Then in his lifetime he
must have been a sort of recluse. It isn’t hard for a
recluse to get kind of queer in his head, so we could
safely conclude that the dead house owner had been
queer. Therefore he was subject to doing queer
things—could even have planned things to happen
to a queer purpose after his death.</p>

<p>All right. That was that.</p>

<p>To go further, there had been a son, Harold Danver,
of whom we knew very little except that he had
quarreled with his father, nor had the quarrel been
patched up at the time of the younger one’s death.
Married to a woman who was “much too big for her
shoes,” to use the housekeeper’s words, the son had
left a daughter named Ruth, or, as the housekeeper
had respectfully expressed it, “Miss Ruth.” The
daughter-in-law with the big feet had kept up the
family quarrel, even telling the granddaughter that
she couldn’t go to the funeral when the head of the
house died. At the death, which had been sudden—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
this hinted at mystery!—all of the relatives had
flocked in, of whom none were more hopeful of getting
a handful than “Ma” and “Pa.” Disappointment!—the
will wasn’t to be read for a year. On this
occasion “Ma” had gone snooping, to the awful
discovery that the casket had a “queer” smell—a
drug-store smell. Evidently after the funeral the
house had been closed up and the keys sent to the
granddaughter. Since then the better part of a
year had passed. And now, when it was almost
time to open and read the will, the granddaughter
had made mysterious plans to have the
house opened for her. She was to come quietly and
secretly on the seventh of the month, which was two
days before the time set for the reading of the will.
Coming to the house at the granddaughter’s secret
request, “Ma” and “Pa” had found “queer smells,”
slamming doors, creaking windows, and the like.</p>

<p>We spread out the dope like this:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(1) Had Corbin Danver died naturally? Or
if certain life secrets had something to do with
his sudden death, what were those secrets?
Was it possible for Poppy and I to get wise to
them?</p>

<p>(2) Why had the grandfather given the granddaughter
the keys of his home? Why did he want
his will shut up for a year?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>(3) Was the will going to be a big surprise to
the relatives?</p>

<p>(4) Were certain people secretly posted on the
will doing stuff ahead of time to make themselves
safe when the will was read?—the granddaughter,
for instance. (The “queer smell,” door slamming,
and so on, came in here.)</p>

<p>(5) What was the connection, if any, between
the granddaughter’s disappearance and the spotted
gander? Where had “Pa” been during the earlier
part of the evening?</p>

<p>(6) What was liable to happen to Poppy and
I if hidden eyes caught on that we were trying to
untangle the mystery, as we wanted to do, if the
chance came our way?</p>
</div>

<p>Well, as I say, with the door wide open and so much
“ghost” talk in my head, I had no idea of going to
sleep. It didn’t seem possible to me that I could
drop off. Yet I did. And so did Poppy.</p>

<p>Suddenly I was lifted ten feet into the air by an
old gee-whacker of a thunderclap. And when I
came down to earth again, and realized where I was,
maybe you think I didn’t do some quick neck-stretching
to see if there was anything white in the
room with us. But we were safe.</p>

<p>Boy, was it ever pouring outside! I got up and
went to the window. I don’t know—maybe, half<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
awake and half asleep as I was, I expected to see
the bushes floating around. Or even the barn.</p>

<p>A hundred electric generators were sending out
lightning flashes. One after another. So it was easy
for me, and for Poppy, too, who stood beside me, to
see the flooded world below.</p>

<p>Suddenly the other caught his breath. He had
seen something!</p>

<p>“Jerry!” he pointed. “Look down there by that
big bush. No, more to the right. What do you see?”</p>

<p>“A man,” I breathed.</p>

<p>The leader then began to jerk on his clothes. And
I knew without being told that he was going out in
the storm to learn, if possible, who the spy was.</p>

<p>That’s old Poppy for you! Every time! And do
I ever love that kid for his wonderful grit. He’s
one pal in a million.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br>

<small>THE “GHOST” IN THE KITCHEN</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Now</span>,” says Poppy, when he was dressed, “you
wait here at the window. I’ll go out the back way,
taking the door key with me. And to play safe,
I’ll circle to the front road. You may not see me at
first. But don’t let that fuss you. Give me ten
minutes and I’ll be there.”</p>

<p>I felt sort of calfy in the separation—as though
he was giving me the soft end.</p>

<p>“Why can’t I go, too?” says I, wanting to be as
brave as he was. “Then you’ll have me if you need
me.”</p>

<p>But he shook his head, laughing.</p>

<p>“You’re the guy who lights up the old South
Church tower,” says he.</p>

<p>Every American kid knows that poem.</p>

<p>“And who are you?” I grinned, getting a slant
on his scheme. “Paul Revere in a raincoat?”</p>

<p>“Bu-lieve me,” came with another laugh, “it
would be ‘Paul Revere in a bathing suit,’ if I had
one. For I hate the thought of getting these clothes
soaked. I guess, though, it can’t be helped.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>I hinted around then that a little lucid information
about my “old-South-Church-tower” job wouldn’t
be out of place. So he got down to business.</p>

<p>“Here’s the dope, Jerry: You’re to watch that
guy down there. If he moves to another bush, or
toward the house, keep track of him. Then, as in
the poem, twitch your flashlight <i>once</i> if he’s still
there, and <i>twice</i> if he’s moved. Getting your signal,
I’ll let you spot me in the lightning and signal back
with my cap. See?”</p>

<p>“I get you,” I nodded, writing down the instructions
in my mind.</p>

<p>“After that,” came the further dope, “keep track
of us both, and guide me. One flash up and down
will mean that I’m ‘cold,’ two will mean that I’m
‘warm,’ and three will mean <i>danger</i>—scoot for
your life. But keep a steady grip on yourself, old
pal, and don’t flash ‘danger’ unless there <i>is</i> danger.
When I’m all through, I’ll signal again with my cap.
Then you can wait for me in the kitchen, where
we’ll dry my clothes.”</p>

<p>Left alone, and kind of shaky, too, in the separation,
I got my nose against the window, as the leader had
said. I was careful, though, not to show myself
any more than I could help. For I didn’t want the
spy to get hep to the fact that I was watching him,
while he in turn watched the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>Poppy had said to give him ten minutes. So I
started counting off the seconds. When I came to
sixty that meant a minute, and I crooked a finger.
Pretty soon I had all ten fingers and thumbs crooked.
So I got ready with my flashlight.</p>

<p>The man hadn’t moved. That is, he was still
behind the bush where we first had seen him. So
I gave one flash. I did it in the dark, of course,
though it wasn’t dark very often, for the lightning,
like an octopus, was swinging a hundred fiery tails.</p>

<p>Watching the road beyond the stone wall, I presently
got sight of Poppy, a sort of skulking black spot
in the continued storm. He was waving his cap,
showing that my first signal had gotten to him all
right. I was glad to see him. I felt safer in knowing
that he was safe. Then, on the job, I gave him two
quick up-and-down flashes, for the sharp-eyed spy,
as though alarmed by the window signal, was heading
for the road, and that, as I say, is where my chum
was.</p>

<p>But pretty soon the man stopped short and sort of
crouched behind another bush, of which a dozen or
more were scattered, to a fancy plan, up and down the
edges of the graveled drive. Poppy was inside the
stone wall now. He was getting closer and closer
to the spy, so I kept on with the two up-and-down
flashes. The signals were working as slick as a button.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
I thought how easily I could yank my chum out of
danger—three twitches of my thumb, as it rested
on the switch, and the trick would be done. He
could scoot to cover before the man caught him.
Easy.</p>

<p>And now comes a part of my story that I hate to
write down. The recollection of it gives me cold
shivers. Talk about trapped people turning gray-headed
over night! The wonder to me is that my
hair didn’t turn <i>green</i>.</p>

<p>The flashlight suddenly went on the bum. There
you are! You can see what a fix I was in, or, rather,
what a fix Poppy was in. Getting no signals from
me, he would think that everything was lovely.
He’d keep on. And how was I going to warn him if
the spy took after him?</p>

<p><i>Matches!</i> As the thought jumped into my head,
I ran to the dresser. But to no success. Then, sort
of crazy, I began to go through my clothes, though
I should have known that I would find no matches
there—for what few matches we carried were in a
waterproof case in Poppy’s hip pocket. In dividing
our truck he had taken the matches and I had taken
the cake of soap.</p>

<p>I remembered then that there were matches galore
in the kitchen. I had seen them in a little box near
the stove. To get a handful wouldn’t take more than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
a minute or two. Hot dog, was my great joy. I
could save old Poppy yet.</p>

<p>I was out of the room and down the hall like a
streak. Nor did I miss a lamp, for by fits and jerks,
as the lightning came and went, the hall, with its
big end windows, was almost as bright as day.</p>

<p>Scooting along in my bare feet I made no more
sound than a cat. Nor did I stir up any racket on
the back stairs. Suddenly, though, as I came to
the bend in the stairs, I stopped short. Talk about
slamming on the <i>brakes</i>! Boy, I skidded seventeen
feet with locked wheels. Smell the rubber. Phew!
There was a light in the kitchen. A moving light.
Its reflection on the wall ahead of me, where the
stairs turned, is what had stopped me.</p>

<p>It wasn’t Poppy. I knew that. As for Mrs. Doane
and her cuckoo husband, they were in bed. Seemingly,
I thought, with a queer feeling not easy to explain,
I had tumbled into an entirely new part of the mystery!</p>

<p>Was it the ghost? If so, then the spy in the storm
was a second party, of whom we knew nothing, for
certainly, as my good sense pointed out, the man
couldn’t be in both places at once.</p>

<p>I suddenly was sort of suffocated under the weight
of the growing mystery. It seemed so—so sort of
<i>tremendous</i>. A spy outside, with the rain beating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
down on him (though evidently he didn’t notice it or
mind it) and a “ghost” inside! How many more
people were there, I wondered, in the crazy hidden
tangle? And whether they were working together,
or against each other, what was their secret purpose?
Property! That must be it. In his grave less than
a full year, his will about to be read, greedy hands
were already reaching out in the dark, in evil schemes,
for the dead house-owner’s property. That’s the
way it is when some rich men die. And Corbin
Danver, the housekeeper had told us, had been a
millionaire.</p>

<p>I don’t think that it’s any discredit to me that I
sort of dropped Poppy out of my mind at this point.
He was able to take care of himself, was my quick
decision, seeing that I had other work to do. Not
being dumb, he’d begin to wonder when the signals
stopped. He’d go slow. And that would make him
safe. In a pinch, he could take to long legs, and
outside of Spider Whickleberry and myself, if there’s
anyone who can fan legs any faster than old Poppy,
I don’t know who it is, though usually he runs at
things instead of away from them.</p>

<p>Yes, the leader was safe enough, I concluded.
And to that point, he might even be safer than me!
For here I was, not twenty feet from the ghost, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>wanting to go on, to see who the “spook” was, there
was no telling where I might end up. Instead of the
leader getting laid out cold, it might be little dew-drop!</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="p064">

THE KITCHEN DOOR">

THE KITCHEN DOOR.<br>

<i>Poppy Ott and the Galloping Snail.</i><span class="gap">     <i>Page <a href="#Page_65">65</a></i></span></p>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But here was my chance; I hung on doggedly. I
wasn’t going to back down. For how would Poppy
feel toward me to learn that I had hid from the
ghost in a closet? No, instead of backing up, the
thing for me to do, I realized, getting out all my
grit, was to go farther down the stairs, even around
the bend. Then I could see into the kitchen.</p>

<p>So down I went, slowly you may be sure, and on
tiptoe. I was at the bend now. Another step;
two steps. I could see a man in a long white nightshirt—ghostly
enough, all right! Stooped over, he
was doing something to the lock of the kitchen door.</p>

<p>Well, if you must know the truth, I felt sort of
weak as the “ghost” turned his face. For who do
you think it was? Yah, you guessed it—nobody but
old Ivory Dome himself!</p>

<p>As I say, the discovery sort of amazed and stunned
me. And yet, I thought, my mind jumping back
to the housekeeper’s crazy story, who besides old
Ivory Dome could better have played the “ghost”
here? Dumb in his wife’s eyes, the finest chance in
the world had been given him to fool her. And he
<i>had</i> fooled her, all right! More than that, he had
fooled all of us. He let on that he didn’t know where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
the granddaughter was. But he did. He knew the
gander’s secret, too. In fact he knew a hundred
things in the mystery that his sharp-tongued wife
never suspected, with all of her wonderful family
smartness! <i>She</i> was a Danver, was the way she
had patted herself on the back, and <i>he</i> was a Doane.
A thick-headed lot, the Doanes!—to hear her tell it.
Say, she was good. Hip-hip-hurray for old Ivory
Dome, I thought, glad at the moment, though
fooled, too, that old henpecked was coming out
ahead.</p>

<p>Of course, to a point of detail, a number of things
needed explaining—for instance the old man’s
trick of slamming the death-chamber door every
night at ten o’clock. As for the “queer smell,” he
probably carried a bottle of it in his pocket. How
simple everything was now! Yet we had let the
“mystery” bewilder us! Fine detectives, we were.</p>

<p>“Pa! Pa!” Above me the woman’s shrill voice
rang through the house. Boy, was she ever yipping
it off! “Pa! Where are you? <i>Pa!</i>”</p>

<p>Quick as scat, the light went out in the kitchen.
Then I heard the old man coming toward me in the
dark, sort of muttering angrily to himself. He was
breathing hard, too. Like a cornered animal. I
got to one side, flat against the wall. And hurrying
up the stairs, the older one passed me without touching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
me. But it was a close shave, I want to tell you.
Phew! Was I ever sweating.</p>

<p>Here a key turned in the kitchen lock. It was
Poppy. The spy had gotten away from him, he
told me, starting to strip off his wet clothes. Then,
stopping, he looked at me and grinned. I don’t
know—when he grins at me that way, as though I
mean so very much to him, like a ton of chewing
gum, or something, it just seems to me as though I
love him a million times. Oh, gee, he’s a peachy kid.
I hope I always have him for a pal.</p>

<p>“What happened to you and the flashlight?” he
inquired. “Did you both go to sleep?”</p>

<p>I quickly ran through my story.</p>

<p>“I’m not surprised,” came the thoughtful nod,
when I wound up. “For, to tell the truth, I half
suspicioned the old man of putting on, though I
think he was dizzy enough right after the accident.
Later on I noticed a sort of crafty look in his eyes,
which set me to thinking. He’ll bear watching,
all right.”</p>

<p>“Shall we tell Mrs. Doane?”</p>

<p>The other laughed.</p>

<p>“You must hate the henpecked old man, Jerry,
to suggest a thing like that. For what Mrs.
Samantha Ann <i>Danver</i> Doane would do to him, huh?
Boy, oh boy! No, let’s keep his secret. Then by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
watching him, and finding out <i>why</i> he’s doing these
things, we ought to quickly clear up the mystery.”</p>

<p>I saw what Poppy meant. We knew what the old
man was doing, but we weren’t wise to his object.
And to get wise was to be our job.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose,” was the theory I then brought
out, “that the old geezer is working with the spy,
and that he came downstairs to-night to let the
other man in the house?”</p>

<p>“That’s a good guess. But it so happened that <i>I</i>
had the door key. See? Hence disappointment for
old Ivory Dome, and possibly, as you say, for the
other guy, too.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t get a look at him?”</p>

<p>“No. I was within a few feet of him once, but he
gave me the slip. I think he lit out for New Zion.”</p>

<p>“Anyway,” says I, “you wouldn’t have known who
he was if you had seen his face. For the people
around here are all strangers to you.”</p>

<p>“I could have described him to Mrs. Doane.”</p>

<p>Having dried Poppy’s clothes beside the kitchen
fire, we went to bed, at one o’clock, and slept until
breakfast time.</p>

<p>“Laws-a-me!” was the familiar exclamation that
greeted us when we came downstairs. “It does beat all
how some boys can sleep. I dare say you never heard
me screeching my head off in the middle of the night.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>“No,” says Poppy truthfully, “<i>I</i> never heard you.”</p>

<p>“Waking up suddenly, I missed Pa. He wasn’t
in bed where I put him. And where do you think I
found him—<i>sleep</i>walking, mind you. Imagine!
As though he wasn’t dumb enough without trying
<i>that</i>. Oh, dear! If he isn’t enough to tax the
patience of a saint. No wonder I have to watch
him like a child. <i>Pa!</i>” then came sharply. “Quit
gurgling in the wash basin.”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t gurglin’,” whined the old man, as he
fiddled at the sink, washing his face and hands.
“I jest choked.”</p>

<p>“Well, quit your choking then. Laws-a-me! For
see what happened to your Cousin Peter when <i>he</i>
choked. The poorest funeral <i>I</i> ever was at.”</p>

<p>“I kain’t help it if I choke,” came grumpishly.
“An’ I kain’t help it, nuther, if I <i>sleep</i>walk. No,
I kain’t.”</p>

<p><i>Sleep</i>walk! I suppose he was asleep when he blew
out the kitchen light and beat it up the stairs! Yes,
he was—like so much mud!</p>

<p>The old trickster!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br>

<small>LAWYER CHEW</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> doing our own breakfast stuff Poppy and I
meandered to the barn and fed the big gander. All
Mrs. Doane could give us in the way of gander grub
was cornflakes in the package, but that seemed to
fill the bill. And, to a point of nonsense, “fill the
bill” is right! Boy, you should have seen that high-toned
corn fodder evaporate when old peppy socked
his molars into it! Part of the time the hungry fowl
ate out of our hands. We let it do that, for, as I say,
it was a swell pet.</p>

<p>“If only it could talk,” says Poppy, “and tell us
where it came from.”</p>

<p>“A talking gander! You don’t ask for much.”</p>

<p>“A talking gander isn’t so much more freaky than
a spotted gander.”</p>

<p>That was true, too. Certainly, I checked up on
myself, in quick thought, <i>I</i> never had seen a spotted
gander before, nor had I ever heard of one.</p>

<p>As though it were wise to what we were saying
back and forth, and wanted to help us clear up the
mystery that hung over it, the gander waddled to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
barn door, sort of eager-like, then came back again.
“Urk! Urk! Urk!” it said over and over, deep
down in its long upholstered windpipe.</p>

<p>I looked at Poppy and laughed.</p>

<p>“What does ‘Urk!’ mean?”</p>

<p>No sooner had I said it than the gander again left
us and waddled to the door. Then, having looked
outside as before, it came back to us with more
“Urk! Urk! Urk!” stuff.</p>

<p>But we were dumb. Whatever its secret was it
couldn’t make us understand.</p>

<p>It was now up to us to sort of decide what we should
do after breakfast. Of course, what we wanted to
do, as I have said, was to stick around and solve the
mystery. But we couldn’t very well do that without
an invitation from Mrs. Doane. For it wasn’t our
mystery.</p>

<p>“You said something about going to Pardyville to
search for the granddaughter,” I reminded in the
course of our talk. “So how would it be for us to
suggest that to the old lady? Then, whether we
found the girl or not, we could come back here and
report.”</p>

<p>“No chance of us finding the girl in Pardyville,
Jerry.”</p>

<p>“You think she isn’t there?”</p>

<p>“If she is, she’s hiding. That’s my idea now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>“Hiding?” says I, looking at him. “What do you
mean?”</p>

<p>“Evidently something unexpected bobbed up to
cause her to change her plans about coming here.
And instead of being stranded in Pardyville, as we
thought last night before we got hep to the old man,
she probably stayed there of her own accord.”</p>

<p>“And sent him back home with orders to keep his
mouth shut, huh?”</p>

<p>“Something like that.”</p>

<p>“Then,” was the somewhat crazy theory that I
now brought out, “it may have been from her that
he got the spotted gander.”</p>

<p>“I thought of that. But from every side it’s a queer
tangled mess. And least of all can I figure out <i>why</i>
the girl should lug a gander to Pardyville with
her.”</p>

<p>“It may be a pet of hers.”</p>

<p>“Possibly. But, if so, why didn’t she keep it?
Why did she send it here instead of coming herself?
And what was her object in planning a secret trip
here in the first place?”</p>

<p>“The old man knows,” I waggled.</p>

<p>Poppy quickly picked that up.</p>

<p>“Old Ivory Dome! I’ll tell the world he knows—the
old trickster!”</p>

<p>“Maybe we can pump him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>“If you notice, Jerry, he does a lot of <i>listening</i>
but blamed little talking.”</p>

<p>I laughed, thinking to myself that the old man
never had a chance to do much talking when his
wife was around. Listening had gotten to be a sort
of habit with him.</p>

<p>“It would be natural for us to think,” Poppy then
went on, “that he was working <i>with</i> the girl instead
of against her. Yet he’s fooling his wife—we know
that. So I can’t help but be suspicious of him,
though I’d hate to think that he could be crooked
enough to sell out his own wife’s people.”</p>

<p>“If he’s working with the girl, then the spy must
be on her side, too,” I figured out, still of the opinion
that the old man and the spy were linked together in
their secret stuff.</p>

<p>“But why should the girl send a spy here?”</p>

<p>“She has old Ivory Dome working on the inside,
and the other guy works on the outside.”</p>

<p>Poppy began to pull his hair.</p>

<p>“<i>Good</i> night! Some tangle, huh?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” says I, “and I want to stay here to see
the finish. For I have a hunch that it’s going to be
exciting. So let us offer to go to Pardyville, as I
say. We may not get wise to any real stuff over
there. But even so we can come back to-night. And
to-morrow morning another excuse may bob up to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
keep us here. If necessary we can <i>make</i> it bob up—clever
little doo-dads that we are! See?”</p>

<p>Poppy grinned.</p>

<p>“Two souls with but a single thought,” he recited,
“two hearts that beat each other. Lead on, kid.
I’m with you till Niagara Falls.”</p>

<p>But I balked on doing the leading—that was his
job, I said. So he set his planner to work.</p>

<p>“C. H. O. is closed,” says he. “Therefore, as I
see it, the only thing for us to do, in case Mrs. Doane
falls for our scheme, is to hoof it through New Zion
to Neponset Corners, where we’ll strike C. H. P.
It ought to be easy for us to catch a ride back to
Pardyville, for with C. H. O. closed the other hard
road will be crowded with cars.”</p>

<p>I let out a yip.</p>

<p>“Why hoof it,” I laughed, “when we have a perfectly
good automobile to ride in?”</p>

<p>The other didn’t need an encyclopedia to get that.</p>

<p>“What!” he squeaked. “Start out in Ivory
Dome’s old junk-pile? You’re crazy.”</p>

<p>“It’ll be fun.”</p>

<p>“But it’s all smashed up.”</p>

<p>“I have a hunch,” I hung on, still grinning, “that
we can make it run.”</p>

<p>“Hot dog!” then came from Poppy, who knows real
fun when he sees it, and away he scooted for the road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>So far as we could see, the old junk-pile hadn’t been
made any junkier by its tip-up. Putting the straight
four back on its wabbly legs, we twisted the engine’s
tail and away it went—the engine, I mean, and not
its tail—as sweet and pretty as seventeen rusty
windmills trying to out-skip each other in a hundred-mile
gale. It was a perfectly gorgeous racket. The
envy that would shine in the other kids’ green eyes,
I thought, all swelled up with pride, when they saw
us—and heard us!—on the road! Oh, baby! We
had the world by the tail.</p>

<p>Handy around machinery, including wheelbarrows
and bicycle pumps, Poppy soon got the hang of
things. And I let old greasy nose fiddle this and
twiddle that to his heart’s content. He was tuning
it up, he said—only he didn’t say it, he yelled it.</p>

<p>Here old Ivory Dome percolated into the landscape.</p>

<p>“Wreck it fast,” he screeched in Poppy’s ear.</p>

<p>The tuner straightened.</p>

<p>“What?” he yelled back.</p>

<p>“Wreck it fast,” the old man screeched again.</p>

<p>“What do you want me to do,” came the greasy
grin, “go at it with an axe?”</p>

<p>Well, I thought I’d die. For old Poppy is as funny
as a yard of pickled pollywogs when he gets that
crazy look on his face. Say, he’s a scream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>“Why spoil a perfectly good axe?” I yipped, to
help keep up the fun.</p>

<p>This “axe” talk, though, didn’t jibe with the
old man’s thoughts.</p>

<p>“No, no,” he screeched, sort of teetering around
and waving his arms. “<i>Wreck</i> it fast. <i>Wreck</i> it fast.”</p>

<p>Poppy gave up then.</p>

<p>“He doesn’t want you to <i>wreck</i> it,” I caught on.
“He’s yelling <i>break</i>fast.”</p>

<p>So we saved the engine further immediate suffering
by turning off the switch and went in to breakfast,
where we managed heroically to get on the outside
of four dozen fried eggs, more or less, and the husky
end of a hill of bacon. There was other stuff, too—a
swell breakfast, let me tell you. Talking and
cooking were sort of twin talents with “Ma” Doane,
as we now called her. Our tasters put us wise to
that, all right.</p>

<p>During the bacon-and-egg vanishing contest we
heard about “Ma’s” dream, which sort of explained
why her mind, usually so jammed full of worry, was
now taking things easy. She believed in dreams, it
seemed. And in this particular dream she had seen
“Miss Ruth” in a pansy garden. Pansies, of course,
were good luck. So everything was all right. More
than that, the dreamer had been handed eight
pansies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>“Which means,” the dream was made clear to us,
“that Miss Ruth is coming on the eighth of the
month, which is to-day, instead of on the seventh.”</p>

<p>Poppy got my eyes and grinned. The big monkey!
He can be as crazy as the next fellow when he tries.</p>

<p>“I had a dream, too,” he laughed. “I dreamt
that I was picking hairy pumpkins, and when I woke
up I had Jerry by the topknot.”</p>

<p>“That’s nothing,” says I, not to be outdone.
“In my dream I was a horse buyer. But I turned you
down, kid, on account of your long ears. Hee-haw!
Hee-haw!”</p>

<p>But our clever little act was wasted. For Ma
wasn’t listening to us at all. In her superior <i>Danver</i>
etiquette, or whatever you call it, she was giving poor
Pa “Hail Columbia” for guzzling coffee out of his
saucer.</p>

<p>“I see,” she then yanked the conversation around
to us, “that you boys know how to run Pa’s car.”</p>

<p>“We made a special study of snails in school,” I
grinned.</p>

<p>“Laws-a-me!” came the quick laugh. “Isn’t that
the <i>craziest</i> name? Some boys painted it on the
car as a joke—it wasn’t us who did it. I wanted
Pa to paint over it, for having the dignity of a <i>Danver</i>
it embarrassed me to travel through the country in a
four-wheeled billboard. But Pa’s ambition is about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
as thin as his wits, so the name never was painted out.”</p>

<p>Then, to our surprise, and before we could get
around to speak on the subject for ourselves, the
little old lady asked us outright if we would delay
our hitch-hike for a day and drive the old car to
town to meet the afternoon train. She was afraid
to let Pa start out alone, she explained; nor did
she want to go herself, having a lot of work to do.
If we would go, she concluded, sort of begging us,
it would be a big accommodation to her, and always
and forever she’d remember the kindness and feel
grateful to us.</p>

<p>Well, as you have a kind of hunch, Poppy and I
didn’t lose any time saying “yes.” I guess not.
So it was quickly arranged, with no objections from
Pa, who sat taking things in with his usual intelligent
look, that we were to start right after breakfast.</p>

<p>That sounds crazy, doesn’t it?—starting out in the
morning to meet an afternoon train, and only twenty
miles to go! But you haven’t followed us yet in the
Galloping Snail! Bu-lieve me, what a fellow needed
more than anything else in driving that mutilated
old wreck, besides courage, was early starts.</p>

<p>Poppy and I, of course, weren’t fooled in the thought
that we’d find the granddaughter at the Pardyville
depot. Dreams were the bunk to us, “pansy”
dreams included. Either the granddaughter, having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
dropped into Pardyville on time, was now hiding
there, to a secret purpose, or, to another view, had
left there on the same day on a later train.</p>

<p>But here was our chance. You tell ’em, kid!
On top of the fun of galloping around the landscape
in the old four-wheeled boiler factory, without
spending any jack of our own, we’d be back on the
job, as Juvenile Jupiter Detectives, in time to clear
up the mystery of the slamming door, and possibly
a few other “mysteries” in which Pa undoubtedly
had a clever little hand.</p>

<p>Breakfast over, Poppy got my ear as I staggered
away from the table.</p>

<p>“That old geezer sure is a puzzle to me, Jerry.
Either he’s all-fired deep, or, to the contrary, gosh-awful
dumb.”</p>

<p>“What’s on your mind now,” says I, loosening my
belt, “besides hair?”</p>

<p>“He knows that we’re starting out on a wild-goose
chase. But did he as much as bat an eyelash?
No, sir! All the time we were talking about the trip
he sat there as blank in the face as a petrified billiard
ball. I thought maybe he’d kick about letting us
use his car, when the trip, as he knows, is all for
nothing. But nary a kick, or anything else.”</p>

<p>“He wouldn’t dare to kick,” I grinned, “with Ma
behind the scheme.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>“What’s that about ‘Ma?’” came a light voice over
our shoulder.</p>

<p>“Say, Mrs. Doane,” Poppy then jumped into a
question that he had for the little old lady, “did
you find out anything about the gander?”</p>

<p>“Laws-a-me! I wish I <i>could</i> find out where Pa
got that gander.”</p>

<p>“Won’t he tell you?”</p>

<p>“He doesn’t remember. If I’ve asked him once
I’ve asked him a dozen times. ‘Pa,’ says I, ‘where
<i>did</i> you get that gander?—now tell me.’ But I
might just as well talk to a hitching post.”</p>

<p>“Did the man who died here have a pet gander?” was
the way the leader further tried to dig into the mystery.</p>

<p>“What! <i>Corbin Danver?</i> No, indeed. As I recall,
he hated geese the same as he hated sweet
cucumber pickles and safety razors.”</p>

<p>“And the granddaughter said nothing about a
gander in her letter to you?”</p>

<p>“Miss Ruth? Laws-a-me, child, what <i>are</i> you
thinking about to ask such foolish questions? Do
you imagine that the gander <i>belongs</i> here?”</p>

<p>Poppy, of course, couldn’t tell her that he had a
hunch that the gander had been sent here for a
secret purpose. For Pa would get it in the neck
then. We knew a lot of things that we had to kind
of tuck away under our caps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>Here we caught the sound of hoofs and steel buggy
wheels in the graveled drive. Was it the granddaughter?
Poppy and I thought so. And a flash
of disappointment came over us. What we wanted to
do was to show our stuff as young detectives. And
it would turn everything upsidedown for us, as you
can see, if the granddaughter now stepped in to
clear up the mystery. Yet we were curious to see
her. That was natural. And in the general stampede
for the front door, to welcome the newcomer, Ma
Doane was not more than a foot or two ahead of us.</p>

<p>But it wasn’t the granddaughter. It was a man—a
big fat man. Boy, you should have seen how he
filled the sagging seat of that spraddle-wheeled buggy.
His stomach stuck up so high in front that he had
to look around it, unable to see over it. Of course,
I don’t mean that <i>exactly</i>—but you get me, I guess.
The point is that the man had started to grow <i>out</i>
at the belt line when he had stopped growing up and
down, and now instead of using an ordinary fifty-inch
belt to hold up his pants he bought engine
belting by the rod, more or less.</p>

<p>Nor was he fat just in one place. His neck was fat,
what little there was of it. And his <i>face</i>! Oh, boy!
He had fourteen chins and his jowls hung down like
apples in an apron. The corners of his big mouth
hung down, too, sort of grim-like. Bulldog stuff.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
We couldn’t see his eyes—they were buried in fat—but
I had a hunch that they were a sort of grayish-green,
like a hungry cat’s.</p>

<p>The human elephant, or whatever you want to call
it, had gotten out of the buggy, after a lot of twisting
and grunting, and leaving the fagged-out, drooping-eared
horse to sort of regale itself on the leaves of
a lilac bush, was now waddling toward the house.
Watching him, all I could think of was a dressed-up
duck. No, I won’t say that he reminded me of a
goose, for I don’t want to disgrace the Admiral by
putting that hunk of human lard in the <i>goose</i> class.
The Admiral was a true friend of ours, as you will
learn, and this over-weight geezer, as you will learn,
too, was nobody’s friend except his own.</p>

<p>Yah, you guessed it. Lawyer Chew, the big guy
in Neponset Corners—mayor, chief of police, church
deacon, school director, banker, street commissioner
and last, but not least, <i>money lender</i>—had arrived
in the capacity of family lawyer to kick us out and
lock up the house.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br>

<small>ALL ABOARD FOR PARDYVILLE</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Who</span> is it?” says Poppy, as the waddler tried out
his weight on the porch steps. “Mark Tidd, Sr.?”</p>

<p>“Search me,” says I, wondering if the heavy watch
chain that the over-fed visitor carried around on his
vest front, like a young suspension bridge, was solid
gold. If it was, he must be a millionaire, I thought.</p>

<p>“It’s Lawyer Chew,” the woman told us in a low
voice.</p>

<p>“Quick!” laughed Poppy, remembering that this
was the enemy. “Get the teakettle.”</p>

<p>“A dose of hot water is what he deserves,” came
stiffly from the fearless little old lady, as she
planted herself, sort of belligerent-like, in front of the
door.</p>

<p>Having successfully dragged himself up the mountain,
like a heaving donkey engine, old fatty stopped
on the top step to swab his bald spot and adjust his
scowl.</p>

<p>“Well, madam,” he boomed at us out of his
inflated stomach, “I’m here.”</p>

<p>“So I see,” says Mrs. Doane quietly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>“As I told you over the ’phone,” proceeded old
dough-face in his ponderous, important way, “you
are outside of your rights in coming here to live.
The late owner of this place instructed me to close
it after his death and keep it closed until the complete
settlement of the estate. So I have come to see that
his wishes are obeyed.”</p>

<p>Say, I wish you could have seen that little old lady
swell up! As I watched her, grinning, all I could
think of was a ruffled bantam getting ready to do
its stuff. Boy, was my thought, if she ever socked
her spurs into old goozleum the goo sure would run.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe,” came hotly, “that Corbin Danver
ever told you to close this house against his relations.
And I defy you to show me any <i>writing</i> to that effect.”</p>

<p>“I know my business, madam.”</p>

<p>“Then tend to it,” was the slap that old fatty got
in the face.</p>

<p>“Hot dog!” laughed Poppy in my ear, as tickled
as a monkey with the cooties. “I guess she handed
him a hot one that trip.”</p>

<p>The visitor’s big ears were on fire now.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Doane,” he rumbled like an angry volcano,
“I didn’t come here to bandy words with you. Nor
do I feel called upon to show you any <i>writing</i> to
back up my position as preliminary administrator
of this estate. His chosen legal adviser, I was given<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
certain definite instructions by the late Corbin Danver,
just before his death, and to the best of my professional
ability I am now trying to carry out those
instructions. As I tell you, you’ve got to pack up
and get out of here. And the sooner you do it the
better for <i>you</i>.”</p>

<p>But Ma held the fort.</p>

<p>“<i>Oh!</i> ... do tell!” came sarcastically. “And suppose
I <i>don’t</i> pack up and get out of here—what then?”</p>

<p>“In that case, madam, I’ll see that the law puts
you out.”</p>

<p>That was more than the high-spirited little old
lady could stand.</p>

<p>“So, you’re going to put me out, are you?” she
cried, shaking her fists in the lawyer’s pudgy face.
“You and the <i>law</i>! I’d like to see you do it. Yes,
you better back up, you big bag of wind. For
two cents I’d twist your fat nose. Maybe you’d
learn then to keep it where it belongs.”</p>

<p>“Madam! ...” thundered the heaving volcano,
as the lava slopped close to the brim.</p>

<p>“Don’t ‘madam’ me. You’re more lucky than
you realize that I don’t fly at you and scratch your
eyes out. Such an insult! And now that you have
had <i>your</i> say, Mr. Lawyer Chew, let <i>me</i> tell you
something: The whole state militia can’t drag me
out of here if I choose to stay. Is that clear to you?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
Not that I’m a person to oppose the law, but in this
case I don’t believe that you have any <i>right</i> to put
me out of here. If Corbin Danver told me <i>once</i>
he told me a hundred times that of all his relations
there was no one whom he enjoyed having here
more than me. I was welcome to come whenever I
chose, he said. Nor did he say that his death was
to make any difference. Yet <i>you</i> try to put me out!
And this in spite of the fact that I was sent here, as
I told you last night, by some one who has every right
in the world to use the property as she sees fit.”</p>

<p>At this mention of the granddaughter, the volcano
sort of subsided. And there was a peculiar crafty
look in the deepset eyes now.</p>

<p>“What is this that you tell me about Miss Ruth
sending you here to open up the house for her? Is
she intending to live here?”</p>

<p>With all of her free talk to us, Mrs. Doane was
foxy about showing her hand to the enemy.</p>

<p>“I’ll let her talk for herself when she gets here.”</p>

<p>“Then she isn’t here yet?” and instead of craftiness
there was satisfaction in the gray-green eyes now.</p>

<p>“If she were,” came sharply, “you’d have been
ordered away from here before this. For while you
may question <i>my</i> right to be here, I don’t think,
if you have any judgment at all, that you would
question <i>her</i> right.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>In the further heated talk between the angry man
and woman, I got the feeling that it was a case of
dog eat dog. They both hated each other. And
probably, I concluded, it was to spite the woman more
than anything else that the visitor was now threatening
to come back in the afternoon with the sheriff.</p>

<p>“Nor will it avail you anything to resist. For I
have the law on my side. And I’m going to use it.
If necessary,” came the final ugly threat, “we can
take you by force and set you down outside of the
stone wall. And that’s where you’ll stay until the
granddaughter gets here.”</p>

<p>Well, say, if he hadn’t backed down the steps I
actually believe that he would have lost what little
hair he had. For take it from me that little old
lady was <i>mad</i>. Drive her out of the house, would he?
Set her down outside of the stone wall in spitework,
huh? Gr-r-r-r!</p>

<p>But she went all to pieces when the angry lawyer
was gone. She trembled like a leaf. And there
was worry and every other kind of grief mixed up in
her thin face. The poor old soul! She had tried
to be brave but her age was against her. I felt sorry
for her. And what I wanted to do to old fatty!</p>

<p>Poppy drew me aside. And as I got a squint
at his face I saw right off that he was getting ready
to do something. He’s that kind of a kid. Let<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
some one he likes get stepped on and he’ll fight his
head off for them. And now, as I saw, hating the
lawyer the same as me, and wanting to fix him, he
was getting ready to take up Mrs. Doane’s battle.</p>

<p>“When did old dough-face say he was coming
back with the sheriff?”</p>

<p>“This afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ve either got to find the granddaughter
this morning or think up some kind of a scheme.”</p>

<p>“It’s easy enough to talk about finding her,”
says I. “But how are we going to do it?”</p>

<p>Here old Ivory Dome percolated through the front
door.</p>

<p>“Jerry, <i>he</i> knows where the girl is.”</p>

<p>“Shall we choke it out of him?” I grinned.</p>

<p>“Bu-lieve me, I’ll try it if necessary.”</p>

<p>“Why ... Ma,” came in a worried voice from the
newcomer. “You look all white. Be you sick?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Pa,” came helplessly. “Lawyer Chew was
here. And he’s coming back with the sheriff to put
us out.”</p>

<p>“Um.... What’s he goin’ to put us out for?”</p>

<p>“Spitework, more than anything. He says that
we haven’t any right to be here.”</p>

<p>“But Miss Ruth has the keys. Her grandpa gave
her the keys. And she sent us here.”</p>

</figure>

<p>“I know, Pa, but Miss Ruth isn’t here yet. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
until she comes we’re helpless. Oh, the humiliation
if that man does put us out in the road! To think
that such a thing could happen to a <i>Danver</i> at the
hands of a man whose grandfather was a horse thief!”</p>

<p>Poppy and I were watching the old man to see
what we could read in his face. For in this new trouble
it didn’t seem possible to us that he could hide
all trace of his secret. Yet we saw nothing—only
dumbness. I began to wonder then if he really knew
as much about the granddaughter’s hiding place and
her other secrets as we imagined. Maybe, I admitted
our error, we were all wrong in our belief.</p>

<p>Poppy had gone into the house. And now I
heard him at the telephone. When he came out he
was grinning. But when I asked him what the joke
was he wouldn’t tell me. I suspected, though, that
he had made the first move against the enemy.</p>

<p>It was now time for us to start for Pardyville. So,
with the old engine heaving and snorting, we loaded
ourselves onto the cushioned back of the Galloping
Snail and gallantly set forth on our journey, yelling
to Ma Doane the very last thing to keep a stiff upper
lip and cook a lot of beefsteak and gravy. For
there’d be five of us for supper, we promised. Down
in our hearts, though, we were saying “maybe.”
Yet it was all right, we thought, to say something
like that to cheer her up. And it made us glad to
know that we left her smiling.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

<small>NO AUTOMOBILES ALLOWED</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Jerry</span>,” says Poppy, as we sort of hurtled down
the sandy country road at the hair-raising speed of
six miles an hour, or less, “that lawyer is a crook.”</p>

<p>“He almost got his nose crooked,” I grinned, remembering
the fracas on the porch of the big stone house.</p>

<p>“He hates Ma Doane, of course—we could easily
see that—but there’s more than spitework back of
his threat to get the sheriff.”</p>

<p>“You think he’s got a <i>reason</i> for wanting to kick
the others out of the house?”</p>

<p>“Absolutely. He talked big about his <i>duty</i> to
the dead man. But that was all bluff. ‘Dollars’
is a bigger thing in his mind than ‘duty.’ You wait
and see if I haven’t got the right line on him.”</p>

<p>“The dope about the granddaughter’s visit didn’t
seem to tickle him for two cents.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell the world it didn’t. And right there is
where we pick up a clew, kid. He doesn’t want her
to come here and use the house. Furthermore, he
doesn’t want Ma Doane or anyone else living there.
See? That’s why he’s getting the sheriff.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>“He knows what’s in the will—Ma said so.”</p>

<p>“Sure thing. And if he’s actually trying to keep
the family of the dead man out of the house, as we
think, it’s a pretty safe bet that he’s doing it to line
his own pockets. For, as I say, he struck me as
being an old money grabber. You know what I
mean—the ‘Shylock’ kind. And I don’t think he
cares a whang whether he gets his money honestly
or not. Men of his stamp usually show in their
faces what they are. And the rogues’ gallery never
held a crookeder face than his.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” says I, “he’s back of the granddaughter’s
disappearance.”</p>

<p>Poppy considered that for a moment or two, then
slowly shook his head.</p>

<p>“I hardly think so, Jerry. For you must remember
that he was dumb on her trip here until Ma spilt the
beans over the telephone. And to that point, it
may have been information that he was after this
morning more than anything else.”</p>

<p>“Information about the girl?”</p>

<p>“Sure thing.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t get much out of Ma.”</p>

<p>“He knows that she’s coming.”</p>

<p>“Gee! I wish we could find her.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t much hopes that we will.”</p>

<p>“But you said we would,” I reminded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>“We’ll try, of course. But we haven’t much to
work on—you can see that. If we do find her, or
get the slightest trace of her, it’ll be more luck than
anything else.”</p>

<p>“I always was lucky,” I grinned. “One time I
found a horseshoe in Main Street, and when I was
picking it up Mr. Kaar’s hearse came along behind
me and wrecked my back porch.”</p>

<p>But this clever little skit was wasted on old sober-sides.</p>

<p>“Say, Jerry,” came thoughtfully, “do you suppose
the spy is a tool of the lawyer’s?”</p>

<p>I looked at him, puzzled.</p>

<p>“But you said the spy and old Ivory Dome are in
cahoots.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he nodded, “I did say that—but it was
just a rough guess.”</p>

<p>“You’re doing too much rough guessing,” I told
him. “You’re getting me all mixed up. For if old
Ivory Dome and the spy aren’t working together, and
the old man didn’t sneak out of bed last night to let
the other in, what <i>did</i> he go downstairs for? When I
first saw him he was trying to open the kitchen door.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” says Poppy thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“What gives you the idea,” I then inquired, “that
the lawyer and the spy are mixed up together?”</p>

<p>“As I say, the lawyer doesn’t want the granddaughter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
in the house. There’s something in the
will, I think, that favors him if he can keep her away.
So, learning from Ma that the girl was coming, he
may have sent some one out to the big house to stop
her.”</p>

<p>“Then the storm came up and the spy got his shirt
tail wet, huh?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and a certain other guy whom you hang
around with more or less got <i>his</i> shirt tail wet, too.”</p>

<p>“You’re sure,” I pinned him down, “that the spy
wasn’t old fatty, himself?”</p>

<p>“Jerry! Don’t you suppose I can tell a hippopotamus
from a rat?”</p>

<p>“All right,” I laughed. “We’ll take it for granted
that the spy was Lawyer Chew’s hired man and not
old hippo himself. And we’ll further take it for
granted that the spy saw you in the storm and got
scared out. <i>But</i>—as the goat says, how about old
Ivory Dome? Where does <i>he</i> come in? We know
about some of his tricks; and we know that he’s
fooling his wife. I can’t make myself believe, though,
now that we’ve talked it over this way, that he’s on
Chew’s side.”</p>

<p>“Nor me,” says Poppy quickly. “I’d sooner
think that he was working <i>against</i> Chew on the granddaughter’s
side, though what his game is in playing
ghost and slamming doors I can’t imagine. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
seems to me, too, that he ought to be able to trust
his own wife. And to that point, you’d naturally
think that the woman would be at the head of any
secret plans to help the granddaughter, instead of
<i>him</i>.”</p>

<p>“Half the time,” says I, “I think he’s D-U-M-B,
and nothing else but.”</p>

<p>“Here, too. Yet we caught him in tricks. So
it’s all right for us to be suspicious of him. That
dumb look of his may be just a sort of mask.”</p>

<p>“Say, Poppy,” I then laughed.</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got an idea about that gander.”</p>

<p>“<i>You</i> with an idea! Be good to it, kid, for it’s
in a strange place.”</p>

<p>“The old man was sent to the Pardyville depot
to get the granddaughter. See? But <i>he</i> knew it
was dangerous for the girl to come here. Old Chew
was liable to cut her throat, or something. And so—”</p>

<p>“For the love of mud!” squeaked the listener.
“What have you been reading?—a dime novel?”</p>

<p>“Anyway,” says I, “old Chew was liable to do
something to her. So Ivory Dome tells her to hide
in Pardyville. See? And then she gives him her
pet gander. And she says: ‘You take the gander
home with you. And as soon as it’s safe for me to
come tie a note to its tail—’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>“It’s <i>tail</i>!” whooped Poppy.</p>

<p>“I mean its hind foot,” I corrected. “She tells
him that. See? And the scheme is for the gander
to take to the air and carrier-pigeon the note to
her.”</p>

<p><i>Bang!</i> Something under the hood sneezed its
shirt off. And jumping for my life, I landed on my
snoot in the middle of the sandy road.</p>

<p>“That’s what you get for your crazy talk,” the
driver laughed at me, when I got up, rubbing my
skinned nose.</p>

<p>“What was it?” says I, letting out my neck at the
smoking car. “A bomb?”</p>

<p>“Carburetor trouble,” says old monkey wrench,
jabbing as unconcerned as you please at something
or other with a screwdriver.</p>

<p>So far in this chapter I haven’t said more than a
mouthful or two about the old junk-pile that we were
escorting around. Nor have I said anything to speak
of about the road over which we were traveling, or the
general lay of the country. As a matter of fact, in
carrying on our gab, as I have written it down, we
didn’t “say” this and that—we yelled it. We had
to in order to get our words into the other’s ears. But
I thought it might get kind of tiresome to you to
have us yelling back and forth like a couple of loud
speakers. So I wrote it down the other way—as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
though we were carrying on a very polite parlor
conversation.</p>

<p>As for the road, if you can imagine a pair of wheel
ruts across the most forsaken part of the Sahara
Desert, that’s the kind of stuff we had to travel over.
Sand, sand and nothing but sand. The only place
where it wasn’t deep was where it was deeper. It’s a
wonder the old car navigated the road at all. And I
didn’t blame it now for wanting to lay down and rest—only
I could have saved some skin on my nose if
it hadn’t used its sneezer on me. That was
kind of unfair, I thought. For I hadn’t picked
on it.</p>

<p>As I have explained in an earlier chapter, this side
road was a sort of forgotten connecting link between
C. H. O., the highway that was closed, and C. H. P.,
the other east-and-west highway on the south side
of the river. According to our map there was a
burg up ahead of us by the name of New Zion, a
community of “religious fanatics,” according to Ma
Doanes’ line, and it was here that we were to cross
the river. Two more miles of soft road beyond the
river and then we would strike Neponset Corners,
the town that Lawyer Chew owned—only it wasn’t
as big as he was—two hundred population, I think.
Yah, you can see now how he came to be mayor and
everything. All the voters owed him money, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
whether they wanted to vote for him or not they
didn’t dare do otherwise.</p>

<p>Well, to pick up my story, I bravely got back in
my seat when Poppy hung up the screwdriver and
crowbar. Then away we went again ... almost!</p>

<p>“What’s the matter now?” says I, necking through
the brass windshield frame to see where the engine
had gone to.</p>

<p>“I killed it,” confessed the chauffeur.</p>

<p>“Well,” says I, ready to overlook the crime, “it
deserved it. But you might have waited until we
got home. For this is an awfully hot place to hold
a funeral.”</p>

<p>“Get out and wind ’er up, you bag of nonsense,
and shut up.”</p>

<p>“Use the self-starter.”</p>

<p>“Say, what do you think this is?—a Rolls-Royce?”</p>

<p>“Yah, a Rolls-Rough.”</p>

<p>“Well, show your stuff, varlet. And when you
get through, fold up the crank and hang it on the
radiator neck.”</p>

<p>“Don’t let the old tub run over me,” I cautioned.</p>

<p>“Trust me, kid,” bragged the driver.</p>

<p>“Have you got the brake set?”</p>

<p>“I’ve just been wondering, Jerry, if there <i>is</i> a
brake. There ought to be one. But I haven’t
been able to find it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>“<i>Good</i> night!” I yipped. “Suppose we came
to the top of a hill?”</p>

<p>“Oh, we can go down the hills, all right.”</p>

<p>“Yah, I guess we can!—seventy miles an hour.”</p>

<p>“Say,” he threw out his chest, “don’t you suppose
I know how to handle this old bus?”</p>

<p>“My life isn’t insured.”</p>

<p>“Anyway,” came the grin, “you aren’t doing
anything useful except rattle around in the seat.
So when we go down the hills you can jump out and
hold us back.”</p>

<p>“The human brake, huh?”</p>

<p>“And when we’re going up the hills,” was the
further job that was shoved at me, “you can get out
and push.”</p>

<p>“One thing in my favor,” says I, “it isn’t a hilly
country.”</p>

<p>Poppy and I have a lot of fun gabbing back and
forth that way. It’s crazy stuff, I know. But we
get a kick out of it.</p>

<p>At ten o’clock we came within sight of a flock of
dingy-looking houses. According to our map this
was New Zion. The road that we were on seemed
to be the town’s main street.</p>

<p>A big weather-beaten sign jumped up in front of
us. And reading it, we were made to understand
why there were no other automobiles on the road<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
except us. We understood, too, why Lawyer Chew
had driven over from his own town in a horse and
buggy.</p>

<p>I made a copy of the crazy sign. Here it is:</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br>

<small>OUR MEETING WITH GOLIATH</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> wasn’t so much sand here. More black
dirt. We could see stuff growing in a field. Still,
it wasn’t the best kind of soil—not for Illinois.
And I had a hunch that Jonah and his gang had
bought the land for a song. That is why they had
settled here.</p>

<p>And what kind of people were they, I wondered,
curious over the outfit, of which there seemed to be
about thirty or forty families, all living in squatty,
unpainted houses. Did the men and women alike
have names out of the Bible? Had they dropped
their own names to take up the Bible names? If
so, was my conclusion, they must be a gang of religious
nuts.</p>

<p>Now, don’t get me wrong. Religion is all right—good
religion, I mean. Take Dad and Mother—they
both belong to the Tutter Methodist church,
and when Sunday comes around we all dress up, as
we should, and trot down the street to listen to the
preacher—only I don’t always stay to hear the preaching,
though I’m always on hand for Sunday-school.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
That kind of religion is all right. It keeps a fellow
honest and square in his own neighborhood. He’s a
better citizen than the fellow who hasn’t any religion.
Take my dad again—you don’t hear <i>him</i> cussing
around like some of the ignorant dumb-bells who
never see the inside of a church. I guess not.</p>

<p>But freak religion is a kind of side-show. It makes
monkey-work out of stuff that God intended to be
serious and sacred. Along comes some half-baked
guy who thinks he’s a prophet, and getting a bunch
of simple-minded people together he starts a “heaven
on earth,” or some such bunk. And usually in the
end he gets the people’s money! I had a second
cousin who got stung that way. A “prophet”
picked him up, with the story that the world was
coming to an end that year, so my soft-headed
relation, after paying for his ascension robe, kept just
enough money to last a year and the “prophet”
got the rest. That sort of reads as though in my
mind all “prophets” are crooks. As a matter of
fact you don’t find many of them doing business.
And out of what few there are probably the majority
really believe their own bunk. They’re just on the
wrong track, that’s all. Kind of cuckoo, to use a
plain word.</p>

<p>I read those names over again: <i>Noah!</i> I had
heard of him, all right—he was the fellow who built<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
the ark. <i>Jonah!</i> Every kid knows the story of
Jonah and the whale. <i>Adam!</i> The fellow who ate
the green-apple pie, of course. <i>Moses!</i> I wasn’t
quite sure about him. <i>Goliath!</i> Oh, yes—David
and Goliath! David was the little wart with the
sling-shot and Goliath was the giant. <i>Zing</i> went the
sling-shot and <i>down</i> went old blunderbuss. Hip-hip-hurray
for David!</p>

<p>“Well, Jerry,” Poppy spoke up, and at the sound
of his voice I sort of cut short my cheering to listen
to him, “what are we going to do?”</p>

<p>“If we believe in signs,” says I, “I guess we’re licked.”</p>

<p>“It’s a wonder Ma Doane didn’t put us wise to
this,” the other grumbled. “Blame the luck!”</p>

<p>“Sh-h-h-h!” says I. “Get out your popgun.
For here comes old Goliath, himself.”</p>

<p>Swinging toward us on high gear, with feet as
big as canal boats, and dressed in faded blue overalls
that were a mile too short for him, the giant, from
whom I never once took my eyes, soon drew up beside
our car. Say, that bird was <i>tall</i>, let me tell you.
A regular walking Woolworth tower, and nothing else
but. Nor was he skinny, like some unusually tall
men. I guess not. His arms at the muscle part
looked bigger around to me than my own body.
What a brave little guy David must have been, I
thought!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>“Howdy, brothers,” came the throaty greeting,
and getting a closer look at the giant I saw now that
there was nothing in his sun-browned face to be
afraid of. “Come fur?”</p>

<p>“Ten miles, more or less,” says Poppy, looking
at the big one curiously.</p>

<p>“Pore road,” the giant waggled, looking down the
sandy trail. “Awful pore road. But then we don’t
need good roads ’round here, fur we never use ’em.”</p>

<p>“Does that sign tell the truth?” Poppy pointed.</p>

<p>“Supposedly, brother; supposedly.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by ‘supposedly?’”</p>

<p>“Wa-al,” came shrewdly, “you’re wantin’ to git
through town, I take it.”</p>

<p>“Sure thing. We’re headed for Neponset Corners.”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” and the voice was a drawl now. “Got
some money, I s’pose.”</p>

<p>“A little,” says Poppy guarded-like, and he looked
at me to see if I had the same suspicions of the stranger
that he had.</p>

<p>“As much as five dollars?” came the continued
drawl, as the man sort of bent over and studied our
faces.</p>

<p>“I think so.”</p>

<p>“Wa-al, then,” came the quick decision, “it’ll
cost you an even five dollars.”</p>

<p>“To go through town?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>“Exactly, brother,” and the man rubbed his hands.
“Exactly.”</p>

<p>Poppy isn’t the kind of a kid to lay down like a
door mat and let other people walk all over him.
I guess not. So you can imagine how sore he was
over the holdup.</p>

<p>“And suppose we want to dance a jig in front of
your skating rink,” says he, sort of sarcastic-like.
“Does that cost us another five dollars?”</p>

<p>“Um ...” came in continued craftiness. “How
much money you got, anyway?”</p>

<p>“None of your business.”</p>

<p>But old Goliath found nothing in that to scowl over.
Instead, he sort of grinned to himself, cat fashion,
as though everything was nice and cozy in the back
part of his mind.</p>

<p>“Um ...” says he, digging puzzled-like at his
hair, which hadn’t seen a barber in sixteen months.
“What day did you say this was?”</p>

<p>“Tuesday,” says Poppy innocently.</p>

<p>“Do tell!” the shaggy eyebrows lifted. “Tuesday,
you say. An’ I sort of had an idear in my head it
was <i>Monday</i>. Almost let two dollars git away from
me that time. You see,” came the further drawl,
and the big boy kind of leaned heavily on us now, “fur
small cars like this ’un, we charge five dollars on
Monday, but on Tuesday it’s seven dollars.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>Poppy promptly turned on the gas.</p>

<p>“Good-by,” says he, “we’ll be back on the thirty-second
of the month.”</p>

<p>But the giant knew a good thing when he saw it.</p>

<p>“Jest a minute; jest a minute,” says he, taking
hold of a front wheel—and bu-lieve me, we <i>stopped</i>!
“If it’s cash in advance,” he came down, “we’ll call
it five-fifty.”</p>

<p>“Guess again,” says Poppy, putting on more gas
to turn around, though to no success.</p>

<p>“Five dollars even,” dickered the wheel holder.</p>

<p>“Nothin’ doin’.”</p>

<p>“Four-fifty.”</p>

<p>“Nope.”</p>

<p>“Brother,” then came the sad waggle, and the blue
eyes shamed us, “you’ve got a penurious disposition.”</p>

<p>“Yah,” grinned Poppy, unable to stay sore at the
queer old geezer, “whatever that is.”</p>

<p>“An’ furthermore, you’ve got a <i>selfish</i> disposition,
my brother. Here I be, a pore, hard-working man— I’ve
got to have money to live on, even if they hain’t
no chewin’ terbaccy in it fur me, yet with money in
your pocket you begrudge me this chance of earnin’
an honest dollar.... I don’t s’pose,” and there was
a hungry, begging look in the giant’s face now as
he bent over us, “that you’ve got a plug of J. T.
tucked away in some inside pocket, hey?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>The old hypocrite! For a moment or two I could
only stare at him. Some fine religion <i>his</i> was!</p>

<p>“Three years ago,” then came the sad story, as
the giant, touched by the memory of his earlier life
wiped real tears out of his big blue eyes, “I was a
man of the world. Chewin’ terbaccy, movin’ pitchers
an’ a car of my own jest like this ’un.... What
is it, a Ford?”</p>

<p>“A Rolls-Royce,” says Poppy proudly, spitting
on his finger and massaging a fly speck on the windshield
frame.</p>

<p>“Of course; of course. Never heerd tell of it
though. Looks kinda shot.”</p>

<p>“And it’s shot worse than it looks,” the grinning
driver admitted.</p>

<p>“Wa-al,” came the continuation of the story,
“steeped in the sin an’ iniquity of the world, an’
with two wimmin wantin’ me to pick ’em fur a wife,
one an actress an’ the other a church worker, I up
an’ made the foolishest move of my life, pickin’ the
wrong one, an’ in consequence here I be in a religious
penitentiary.... Gotta cigarette?”</p>

<p>“We don’t use ’em,” says Poppy, wondering, I
guess, what crazy junk was coming next.</p>

<p>“Any new wars goin’ on?” the giant then inquired.</p>

<p>“Wars?”</p>

<p>“We never git no newspapers out here—they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
hain’t ’lowed—so I don’t know what’s goin’ on more
’an a mile away.... Douglas Fairbanks still livin’?”</p>

<p>The old fellow was dead in earnest. Can you
imagine? No wonder that Poppy and I laughed our
heads off. He had been dragged here against his
wishes by his new religious wife, he said. And to
please her he had let the leader of the gang give him
a Bible name.</p>

<p>He was like a big kid in his talk. Some day, he
told us, with a sort of wistful, far-away look in his
big eyes, he was going to run away from his wife, of
whom he seemed to be scared to death, and go back to
the “sins of the world.” Then he inquired about
the latest prize-fight news, ending up by asking
who was President. I wanted to tell him “George
Washington,” but Poppy told him the truth.</p>

<p>Well, it was fun talking with him, but we were
wasting a lot of good time. Having sort of made
friends with us, he confessed, as we further dickered
with him, that the regular toll fee for going through
town in an automobile was two dollars. If we hadn’t
been smart, you see, he would have stuck us for a
five-spot, knocking down the other three dollars. As
it was, we hated like the dickens to let go of our money,
for to a boy two dollars is two dollars. But there
was no way out of it. Paying him the money, we
sort of rode in state through town, looking for Noah<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
and the whale, but to our disappointment nobody
came to rubber at us. There was a big community
picnic down the river, the giant told us. That’s
where the people were.</p>

<p>Having crossed the river, we came to a steep hill.
And how we ever got to the top of it I can’t imagine.
But we did. From then on the road was more or
less hilly. It was a glad moment, let me tell you,
when we got a whiff of the Neponset Corners slaughter-house.
Hot dog, was our happy thought, as we
cantered into town. The good old concrete now.</p>

<p>I easily picked out Lawyer Chew’s house. For
not only was it big like he was, but it had the owner’s
name chiseled on the stone horse block at the curb.
As further proof, I saw a fat boy in the yard who was
a dead ringer for old Chew himself.</p>

<p><i>Bang!</i> went something under the car. But I
didn’t jump this time. For I had a hunch that it
was a blow-out.</p>

<p>“Lawyer Chew will think that you’re trying to
shoot him,” I grinned.</p>

<p>“Is that where he lives?” Poppy rubbered.</p>

<p>“Sure thing. Don’t you see his understudy on
the lawn?”</p>

<p>The fat kid meandered into the street to watch
the tire repairs.</p>

<p>“Some junk,” says he, turning up his nose—only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
he couldn’t turn it up very high, for it was too fat.</p>

<p>Now, if anybody else had said that we would have
grinned. But not this young geezer. He was too
much like his old man.</p>

<p>“Lookit!” I nudged the tire fixer. “We’ve got
company.”</p>

<p>“Is it human?” says Poppy, taking a sweaty squint.</p>

<p>“It’s got arms and legs,” says I. “Nice plump
ones, too.”</p>

<p>The kid’s face got red.</p>

<p>“Don’t get rosy,” says he, showing us a cute little
scowl, “or you’ll get pinned on.”</p>

<p>“Shall we kill it,” says I to Poppy, “and put it
out of its misery?”</p>

<p>“Huh!” snorted little roly-poly. “You better
shut up, if you know what’s good for you. And you
better git that old junk-pile out of the street, too.
For we don’t want trash like that in front of our house.”</p>

<p>Poppy promptly let out his neck.</p>

<p>“Where is it?” he rubbered.</p>

<p>“Where’s what?”</p>

<p>“The <i>dog</i> house that you were just talking about.”</p>

<p>“Bow-wow,” says I, to help things along.</p>

<p>“I’m going to call my father,” fatty then blew
up, madder than a dozen wet hens.</p>

<p>“Don’t bother,” Poppy turned up his nose, “for
we’ve already met him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>That put the kid wise, which proved that he wasn’t
such a hopeless dumb-bell after all.</p>

<p>“Now I know who youse guys are,” says he, giving
us a pair of evil eyes.</p>

<p>“Who told you, Lena?”</p>

<p>“Lena? Lena who?”</p>

<p>“Lean against ’er.”</p>

<p>“You think you’re smart,” fatty danced. “But
just wait! My father’s going over to Garrison this
afternoon to get the sheriff. And you’ll hear from
him before night—you and that other trashy pair out in
the country. We’ll show you who owns that house.”</p>

<p>“<i>Egg</i>bert!” a woman called from the porch of
the big house. “<i>EGG</i>bert!”</p>

<p>Fatty turned.</p>

<p>“Now we know what it is,” I laughed. “It’s
an egg.”</p>

<p>“Yah,” says Poppy, “a <i>donkey</i> egg.”</p>

<p>“Another crack like that,” frothed fatty, “and
I’ll punch your face.”</p>

<p>“<i>EGG</i>bert!” came the impatient call. “Do you
hear me? Papa wants you to get under the buggy
and tighten a nut. Come now, for he’s hurrying to
go over to Sandy Ridge on business.”</p>

<p>“Yah,” hooted Poppy, “go roll under the family
carryall, <i>EGG</i>bert, and tighten some of the nuts in
your head.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>“Is there a county sheriff in Sandy Ridge?” I
inquired of Poppy, when the kid had gone.</p>

<p>Reading my thoughts, the other laughed.</p>

<p>“Old Chew isn’t heading for Sandy Ridge to get
the sheriff, Jerry. He’s going over there—so he
thinks!—to draw up a will for a deaf and dumb
lady with cork legs who read about him in the Police
Gazette and wants him to take her money and build
a home for crippled nutmegs.”</p>

<p>“<i>Good</i> night!” I stared at him. “Are you cuckoo?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you catch on, Jerry?” he further laughed.
“To keep old Chew from calling in the Garrison
sheriff, I ’phoned here to the house, getting his
wife, and now he’s heading for Sandy Ridge on a
wild-goose chase. He’ll be gone all day looking for
the rich lady with the cork legs, so Ma is safe until
to-morrow at least.”</p>

<p>Our tire fixed, we went another block to the concrete,
only to learn, in sort of sickening disappointment,
that the road to Pardyville was closed. A
bridge had been washed out during the storm, and the
automobiles going east and west were hitting it along
C. H. O., which was open again. Our only way to
get to Pardyville was to go back over the same road
that we had come, and then east on C. H. O.</p>

<p>I now saw that Poppy was worried. And I knew
why. Facing another long trip across the Sahara<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
Desert he was thinking that we never would be able
to get to Pardyville and back that night. Not
that we expected to meet the granddaughter at the
depot, but it had been a sort of vague hope with us
that we would get track of her in town, for Pardyville
wasn’t a big place. If we didn’t find her, or she
didn’t soon show up of her own accord, it would be
all day with poor Ma. And that was no happy
thought for us.</p>

<p>Young fatty yelled something at us when we passed
his house on the way back. But our old buss made
too much racket for us to hear him. Anyway, his
smart gab didn’t interest us.</p>

<p>We never expected to see him again. But we did!
And toward the last under conditions that were

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br>

<small>THE RUNAWAY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">I think</span> it was around eleven o’clock when we pulled
out of Neponset Corners on our way back to C. H. O.
We had been three hours on the road, and if we were
as long going back it would be two o’clock before we
came to the big stone house where we had started
from. To get to the highway from there would eat
up another hour. And how long it then would take
us to get to Pardyville, we could only guess at.
However, we were going to do the best we could.</p>

<p>“If only we had known in starting out,” groaned
Poppy, “that C. H. O. was open. We could have
been in Pardyville by now.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” says I, of a sort of financial turn of mind,
“and we would have twenty dollars in our jeans
instead of eighteen.”</p>

<p>That stirred up the other one to more unhappy
thoughts.</p>

<p>“Good night!” he yipped, yanking the steering
wheel just in time to keep our Rolls-Royce from kicking
over a tree. “Do you suppose we’ll have to cough up
another two bucks to get through that crazy town?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>“I don’t see how we’re going to escape it,” says
I, “unless our gallant little gas chewer grows a pair
of wings.”</p>

<p>“The blamed robbers! It’s a skin-game, Jerry.”</p>

<p>“Nothing else but.”</p>

<p>“Still, I don’t blame old Goliath so much. He’s
got to do what the others tell him, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“He tried to skin us on his own hook,” I reminded,
a bit stiff in my feelings toward the tricky old geezer.</p>

<p>“He didn’t get by with it, so why hold it against
him?”</p>

<p>“You seem to like him,” I grunted.</p>

<p>“I feel kind of sorry for him, if you want to know
the truth of the matter. For he hates it there. He
said so. And for that matter what man with any
sense wouldn’t hate to live in a place like that?
I’d as soon be in jail myself.”</p>

<p>“His wife must be a regular old rip-snorter,” I
laughed.</p>

<p>“She sure has him buffaloed, all right.”</p>

<p>“Some women like to be bossy.... I hope I
don’t get that kind.”</p>

<p>“You!” laughed Poppy. “I didn’t know that
you were thinking of getting married, Jerry.”</p>

<p>I made a sudden grab for my smeller.</p>

<p>“Phew!” I gurgled. “Whiff that old slaughter-house.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>We learned afterwards that the cluster of rickety
buildings set back from the road wasn’t a slaughter-house
outfit, as we had supposed, but a rendering
works. Old dead cows and horses were brought
here to be boiled and then ground up into chicken
feed. To judge from the ravishing smell the dead
animals were left to ripen in the hot sun for two or
three months before they were stuffed into the jaws
of the grinding machine.</p>

<p>When we were in the thickest of the lumpy smell,
the old snail started to shimmey, as though, with some
such feeling as we had, it was getting ready to heave
up its mechanical insides. Then it gave a final stagger
and dropped dead.</p>

<p>“For the love of mud!” I gurgled. “Throw in
the clutch.”</p>

<p>“I can’t make it work.”</p>

<p>“What!” I squeaked. “Are we stalled?”</p>

<p>The other took that as a slam at his driving, I guess.</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” came sarcastically. “I’m just dilly-dallying
along so that we can enjoy the magnificent
scenery. And see the beau-utiful wild flowers!”
he gestured, like a nut. “Aren’t they perfectly
scrumptious?... Climb out, Jerry, and see if a
hunk of the engine is dragging in the sand.”</p>

<p>I got out, all right—and in a hurry, too, let me tell
you. But don’t imagine that I stopped to check up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
on the engine. Not so you can notice it. What I
did instead was to hoof it for the back-line trenches,
away from the firing line, as fast as my number eights
would carry me. Let the dead cows and horses
fight it out among themselves, was my indifference.
Their troubles weren’t anything to me.</p>

<p>Nor did Poppy stick it out very long, with the
hunks of future chicken feed sizzling past his nose
like swarming bullets.</p>

<p>“The beau-utiful wild flowers,” I mimicked, as
he staggered out of the smoke of battle.</p>

<p>“Traitor!” says he, and he kind of meant it, too.</p>

<p>“What did you expect me to do?” I flung back at
him. “Stand between you and the wind and fan
you with a perfume bottle?”</p>

<p>This last mess proved beyond all doubt that our
luck had deserted us. Whether we had seen them
or not, thirteen black cats had skulked across our
path that morning. Nor did it add any to the joy
of the occasion to have the leader and I growling at
each other. Anyway, to our credit, we aren’t the
growling kind. So pretty soon we were all right
again. And seeing the funny side of our crazy adventure
we almost laughed our heads off.</p>

<p>“Whistle,” says I.</p>

<p>“What for?” says Poppy.</p>

<p>“Maybe it’ll come to you,” says I, pointing to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
the car, suffering in the thickest of the gas attack.</p>

<p>“How would it be,” grinned Poppy, “if we climbed
the fence and moved the stink factory?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got it!” I yipped. “Let’s turn off the
electric fan,” meaning the wind.</p>

<p>“And we used to think that Limburger cheese
was delicious!”</p>

<p>“And sauerkraut,” I gagged in company.</p>

<p>At noon the thick smell sort of quieted down.
Either the wind had switched or the supply of ripe
horses was running low. We could stand it now to
go back to the car, where Poppy got to work. And
did any music, even a calliope, ever sound as sweet
to me as the first healthy snort that came out of that
old engine when the tinkerer finally got the jigger
cornered that was causing all the grief.</p>

<p>But within ten minutes we were hung up again.
Nor could we get anything out of the old engine now
except the weakest kind of a wheeze. We cranked
and cranked. Boy, it was hot work. Our tempers
were hot, too. Yes, and our stomachs were <i>empty</i>.
Don’t forget about that.</p>

<p>Poppy was thorough. He unscrewed everything that
wasn’t riveted down. At one time we had enough
junk spread around in the sand to build six engines.
And the funny part is that the more stuff we took
away from it the healthier the old gas eater sneezed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>We worked till six o’clock. Then we gave up.
It was no use, Poppy said. And if you could have
seen how greasy and fagged out that poor kid
was you sure would have had a hunk of pity for
him.</p>

<p>What should we do now—get a garage man from
Neponset Corners, or go on afoot? I knew something
about garage bills. One time I fiddled with
Dad’s car and it cost him seventeen dollars and fifty
cents to find out that my new way of attaching the
sparkplug wires wasn’t a complete success. All we had
with us was eighteen dollars. And what could any
garage man do to this old junk-pile with eighteen
dollars? Certainly, with the big end of our hitch-hike
still ahead of us we would need every cent that
we had. So we decided to hoof it for home. Yet
the thought of that long sandy walk had us licked
before we started in.</p>

<p>Weak as he was, Poppy still had a voice.</p>

<p>“Anyway,” says he, as a final effort, “we’ll give
it ten more cranks apiece, and then if it won’t start
we’ll kiss it good-by ... and hope that in the next
world it suffers as much as it has made us suffer.”</p>

<p>“I’ll crank it first,” says I, seeing how fagged out
he was.</p>

<p>Well, can you imagine our great joy when the old
hunk of iron, at the first twiddle of the crank, grabbed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
the bit in its teeth and started off as friskily as a
two-year-old colt!</p>

<p>“There you are,” says I, acting big. “Any time
you want it started, kid, call on a <i>real</i> mechanic.”</p>

<p>“Quick!” cried the driver. “Jump in before it
stops,” and joining him in a flying leap, away we
went down the skyline at our usual break-neck
speed.</p>

<p>But the jinx that was trying to chloroform us
with bad luck hadn’t used up all of its dope. <i>Bang!</i>
went a hind tire. That meant another hour. It
was growing dark now. Instead of getting a look
at Pardyville that day, we’d be lucky if we saw the
inside of the big stone house before midnight. A
whole day wasted! And the two of us done up for
nothing, as you might say. No wonder we were
out of sorts.</p>

<p>It was eight-thirty when we crossed the river.
New Zion was just ahead of us. But the whole
town was in darkness.</p>

<p>“They go to bed early,” I yelled at Poppy, as
we hurtled along like a crippled turtle.</p>

<p>“Without any picture shows to go to, or anything
to read, what else can they do?” the driver yelled
back.</p>

<p>“Maybe,” I yelled then, “we can get through town
without them catching us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>Quick to act on that thought, Poppy stopped the
engine and switched off the lights, of which only
one was working up in front.</p>

<p>“If we use our wits, Jerry, we ought to be able to
save that two dollars. For instance,” came the plan,
“as soon as old Goliath stops us, instead of forking
out our two dollars, we’ll hit him for something to
eat. Two suppers will be four bits in his pocket, we’ll
tell him. All right. When we get ready to leave
for home the old engine won’t run. We accidentally
dropped a gee-whacker. See? And you go back
with him to try and find it. That gives me a chance
to beat it. And once outside of town, I’ll shut off
the lights and wait for you.”</p>

<p>“Lovely!” says I. “And suppose old blunderbuss
grabs me and takes the two dollars out of my hide?”</p>

<p>“Shucks! As soon as he hears the engine running
he’ll start back on the gallop. Then you can easily
follow him in the dark.”</p>

<p>“And how about yourself?” says I. “You’ll be
out of luck if the old bus stalls before you get away.”</p>

<p>“If I put up the two dollars, he can’t any more than
bawl me out.”</p>

<p>“All right,” I gave in. “If you’re willing to take
a chance, count me in, too.”</p>

<p>I got out then to jiggle the crank. And what do
you know if I didn’t actually fall over old Goliath’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
big feet. He had been standing in the dark taking
in every word we said! And right then, let me tell
you, is one of the times in my young life when my
heart, as the saying is, did a neat little loop-the-loop
in the roof of my mouth. For see how big he was!
<i>Good</i> night!</p>

<p>But the giant didn’t grab me and start twisting
me into fancy bowknots, as I had feared that he
would. Instead, as I stumbled, he steadied me as
gently as you please.</p>

<p>“Sh-h-h-h!” says he in a sort of drawling whisper,
to keep me from yelling, I guess. “You boys got
here jest in time to help me.”</p>

<p>My voice was gone. I had swallowed it. But
Poppy still had his.</p>

<p>“Help you?” says he. “What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I’m runnin’ away. I hain’t a-goin’ to live here
no longer, like a prisoner, an’ have a woman boss me
’round. No, I hain’t! I jest set my foot down.
An’ now that you boys is here, I won’t have to walk.”
He started to get into the car. “Shove over, Sonny,
an’ I’ll show you tricks with the steerin’ wheel that I
picked up when you young sprouts was jest learnin’
how to wear pants as wasn’t hitched onto you with
safety pins.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br>

<small>DR. MADDEN COMES HOME</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Poppy</span> and I were doing a sort of double-decker
stunt now. We had to in riding with old Goliath,
for he took up two-thirds of the seat. But we didn’t
kick, however crampy it was for us. As a matter
of fact, we were only too glad it wasn’t any worse.
Think what might have happened to us if old heavy-weight
had been tending to business, as official toll
collector, instead of scheming to his own escape.
Br-r-r-r!</p>

<p>I guess, if the truth were known, we acted kind of
simple. You know how it is with a fellow when he
gets caught with his fingers in the company jam jar.
We didn’t know what to say. And every minute
we expected old blunderbuss to get his memory to
working on our trickery, as he had overheard it, and
start bawling us out.</p>

<p>But to our surprise he was as nice as pie. Either
he had completely forgiven us, we decided, or in some
dumb way had failed to catch on. So it wasn’t
hard for us to put away our uneasiness. More than
that, in our happy-go-lucky way, we brought out a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
pair of perfectly good grins. And to that point,
I don’t know how any kid with fun in him could have
ridden beside that old geezer without grinning. Say,
that was <i>some</i> ride. First a tree would jump at us
out of the darkness, then the corner of a house, then
a hunk of sidewalk. It was a lucky thing for all of
us that the whole town was asleep. For otherwise
we might have been jailed for intoxicated driving,
or whatever you call it—like the time back home
when Paddy Gorbett drove into the Presbyterian
church and started bawling the minister out because
the garage was full of pews.</p>

<p>To a rosy view of things, how handy old Goliath
would be, we thought, if the Galloping Snail got
another balky spell. Big as he was, he could push
beautifully. If necessary, with so much muscle,
he could <i>make</i> the old engine zip whether it wanted to
or not. So it couldn’t put anything over on us. We
really were lucky in having him along, we concluded.
And most wonderful of all, we had saved our two
dollars, though not in the way we had schemed. To
this point, however, as you will see, our joy soon lost
its jiggles. Like the man with the nest of rotten eggs,
we had counted our savings before they were hatched.</p>

<p>Having navigated into one end of Main Street and
out the other, without upsetting anything any bigger
than the car itself, the driver suddenly remembered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
that he had a duty to perform and stopped outside
of town.</p>

<p>“Boys,” says he in that deep drawl of his, “we
want to be fair an’ square. Fur in startin’ out in
any undertakin’, this ’un unexcepted, a feller never
gits very far who isn’t fair an’ square.”</p>

<p>“Meaning which?” says Poppy suspiciously.</p>

<p>“We owe the town two dollars. An’ it’s our
bounden duty to pay it. Then we kin leave here
with a clear conscience.”</p>

<p>“Forget about your conscience,” says Poppy
quickly, “and throw in the clutch.”</p>

<p>“No, I kain’t do that. In runnin’ away from my
wife, I’ll have enough on my mind without wantin’
my conscience to further prick me in the thought
that, through me, these pore suckers, who don’t git
six square meals a year, was cheated out of eight good
soup bones.”</p>

<p>The upper deck nudged me.</p>

<p>“I know a good scheme, Mr. Goliath.”</p>

<p>“Um.... Hopple is my name—Samuel Cassibaum
Hopple.”</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Hopple,” came the foxy plan, “knowing
the layout as you do, suppose you go back and ask
Noah if we can’t have a special evening rate—a dollar
and ninety-eight cents, or something like that. As
you’re leaving with us, I think the gang in the ark<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
ought to sort of set up the treats. Don’t you?”</p>

<p>But old Samuel Cassibaum Goliath Hopple was
no dumb-bell. Not on Tuesday evening, anyway.</p>

<p>“Um ...” came sharply, to let us know that he
was setting his big foot down and wanted no further
nonsense from us. “You jest come across with
that two dollars an’ quit tryin’ to work me.”</p>

<p>“But, listen—” Poppy hung on.</p>

<p>“They hain’t nothin’ to ‘listen’ to. We owe the
money. An’ bein’ an honest an’ upright man, I
hain’t a-goin’ to have it on my conscience that I
skipped out an’ never collected it. It’s my last
duty.”</p>

<p>But Poppy was as hard to corner as a lost collar
button.</p>

<p>“You say <i>we</i> owe the town two dollars. All right.
How much do you weigh?”</p>

<p>“<i>Me?</i>” came in surprise. “About three hundred
pounds.”</p>

<p>“Jerry and I together don’t weigh that much,”
says Poppy. “So, according to weight, you pay a
dollar and we pay fifty cents apiece.”</p>

<p>But did old hefty fall for that clever little scheme?
Not so you could notice it. Nor did he let us argue
the matter further. Put up and shut up, were the
orders we got, so, though we hated him now, we
“put up,” as he expressed it, and thus saved our hides.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>Taking the key of the car with him so that we
couldn’t skin out, he was gone at least ten minutes.
But if he woke up the gang in the ark to deliver the
two dollars to them, there were no distant lights or
sounds to prove it. Certainly, we didn’t hear any
elephants or camels doing their stuff. The big boy
was wiping his eyes when he came back. Even when
a fellow’s wife had the rolling-pin habit, he told us
sadly, blowing his nose, there was a certain amount of
regret in leaving her.</p>

<p>Then on we went into the night, the old bus rattling
and groaning as though each minute would be its last.
But it held up, which showed that old Goliath was
bringing us good luck, even though we had lost our
two dollars. So it wasn’t right for us to hate him.
Anyway, as I told Poppy, though the collection of
the two dollars had seemed unnecessary to us, the
big one had done what he thought was right. And
when a fellow does that you’ve got to give him credit
for it.</p>

<p>It was our scheme now to take the old geezer home
with us and put him up for the night. Ma Doane
wouldn’t care. And with a “spook” to catch and
various other mysteries to solve, it wasn’t a bad
plan, as you can see, to have a big guy like that on
our side. If we went to Pardyville in the morning,
he could go with us. Or if he was ready at breakfast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
time to go back to his wife and let her lovingly use
the rolling pin on him, that was all right, too. We
weren’t particularly interested in his plans.</p>

<p>Presently we met a horse and buggy in the sandy
trail. I thought of Lawyer Chew right off. That
was natural. But it wasn’t old fatty. Pulling out
to let the rig go by us, and stopping for safety, I
had the queer feeling, as our skinny light struck the
buggy, that a pair of gimlet eyes were boring holes
through us. Who was this thin-faced, foreign-looking
man, I wondered, uneasy in the meeting.</p>

<p>Goliath then told us that it was Dr. Madden of
Neponset Corners.</p>

<p>“I used to see a lot of him before he went to Europe.
Guess he jest got back. Some one told me he was
expected home to-day.”</p>

<p>I had forgotten that Ma Doane had spoken of this
doctor. But Poppy hadn’t. Bu-lieve me, that kid
doesn’t forget about anything.</p>

<p>“Isn’t this the doctor,” says he, “who took care
of the old man in the big stone house before he died?”</p>

<p>“Um.... Reckon you mean Mr. Corbin Danver.
Yes, Dr. Madden had that case.”</p>

<p>“Is he a friend of Lawyer Chew’s?”</p>

<p>“Who? Madden? Possibly. I kain’t say.”</p>

<p>“Do you know Lawyer Chew very well?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>“Humph! I know him by hearsay an’ sight. An’
that’s enough fur me.”</p>

<p>“You don’t think much of him?”</p>

<p>“No, nor of snakes, nuther.”</p>

<p>“Do you like Dr. Madden?”</p>

<p>“Him? Wa-al, I might like him better if he wasn’t
so kind o’ <i>queer</i>.”</p>

<p>“Queer?” says Poppy.</p>

<p>“He’s got queer eyes fur one thing.”</p>

<p>“Eyes that look a hole through a fellow, huh?”
I put in.</p>

<p>“Exactly. He gives you the feelin’ when he’s
around you that he’s constantly <i>lookin’</i> fur somethin’.”</p>

<p>“And you never heard,” pressed Poppy, “that he
and Lawyer Chew were particularly chummy, or
that they were mixed up in any kind of property
deals together?”</p>

<p>“Nope.”</p>

<p>“Dr. Madden went to Europe right after Mr.
Danver’s funeral, didn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Ye-es, I think he did. That same week, as I
recall.”</p>

<p>“Did you ever hear <i>why</i> he went to Europe?”</p>

<p>“It was told ’round here that he had gone away
fur a rest.”</p>

<p>“Why? Was the case out here in the country a
bad one?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>“The doctor an’ old Mr. Danver were great
friends. An’ I guess it was an awful blow to the
younger one when the old man died so suddenly.”</p>

<p>“Oh!...” says Poppy, and his hand tightened
over mine. “Then Mr. Danver and the Doctor
were great friends, huh?”</p>

<p>“So I heerd. I know the doctor came out this
way an awful lot.”</p>

<p>“And did he tell around himself that he was going
to Europe to rest?”</p>

<p>“He didn’t tell <i>me</i>. I jest heerd it.”</p>

<p>“Lawyer Chew may have told it.”</p>

<p>“Mebbe.”</p>

<p>“Did you ever hear,” Poppy further questioned,
“that the doctor had any pets?”</p>

<p>“Pets? What do you mean?—dogs and cats?”</p>

<p>“Yes, or ... possibly a gander.”</p>

<p>“A <i>gander</i>! I never heerd of <i>anybody</i> havin’ a
pet like that.”</p>

<p>“Neither Dr. Madden nor Lawyer Chew?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, nor nobody else. Them things people
don’t make pets of.”</p>

<p>What was Poppy’s idea, I wondered, in asking all
these questions. Did he imagine that there was
something crooked in the millionaire’s death, and
that the lawyer and doctor, living in the same town,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
were mixed up in some evil scheme to get the dead
man’s property?</p>

<p>Those boring eyes! Somehow the memory of our
meeting with the man in the buggy gave me the
creeps. Could it be, I further asked myself, that the
doctor had known that we were heading for the big
house, many of whose secrets undoubtedly were
open to him. And didn’t he want us there? Yet
the man’s eyes were naturally queer, old Goliath
had told us. They seemed always to be <i>looking</i>
for something. Looking for what? Did the <i>something</i>,
whatever it was, connect up with the millionaire’s
sudden death? And had the search for the
mysterious <i>something</i> taken the dead man’s medical
friend to Europe?—and this, within a day or two
after the funeral?</p>

<p>Poppy, too, had inquired about pets. Did he
have the crazy idea that there was some secret
connection between the returned doctor and the
puzzling spotted gander? And, further, did my chum
think that the gander, granddaughter and doctor were
secretly mixed up together to a sort of common end?</p>

<p>Crickets! Maybe they did connect up, was my
jumping thought. For certainly, as we knew, they
all had come into the neighborhood at about the same
time—taking it for granted that the granddaughter
wasn’t more than twenty miles away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>Another thing, as the family doctor, the man with
the thin face and eagle eyes knew <i>why</i> the millionaire
had died; or, to put it another way, he knew
what had caused the rich man’s sudden death. The
question was, did Lawyer Chew know, too?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br>

<small>POPPY’S AMAZING THEORY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> he once got the hang of things, old Goliath
wasn’t such a fearfully punk driver. I’ve seen worse.
Shortly after meeting Dr. Madden we very nicely
tried to rainbow over a tree. And turning into the
graveled drive at the big stone house we put on
another sort of dizzy loop-the-loop stunt—two
wheels up and two wheels down. But what was that?
Nothing to crab about.</p>

<p>Poppy looked at his watch when we got out of the
car and stretched our legs.</p>

<p>“Ten-thirty,” says he. And from the way he
spoke I could tell right off that he was thinking about
the death-chamber door. As I have written down,
we had planned on being here to-night when the
mysterious door did its stuff, to sort of check up
on it and thus find out what made it slam. But Fate
had worked against us.</p>

<p>Old Goliath let out his big neck at the lighted
house.</p>

<p>“And this,” says he curiously, “is the shebang
where we’re goin’ to bunk fur the night, hey?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>“This,” nodded Poppy, “is the shack.”</p>

<p>We had told the old man, of course, how we happened
to be staying here. But he didn’t know about
the mystery. For we had no business telling that.
Whatever he found out, we decided, we’d let him get
it straight from Ma Doane herself and not from us.</p>

<p>Having heard us drive in, the little old lady came
running.</p>

<p>“Why!...” she cried, looking the gang over for a
familiar face. “Where’s Miss Ruth?”</p>

<p>Having failed her, we sort of hung our heads as
we told the story of our hard luck. Yet it wasn’t
our fault, we said. We had done our best. It was
a case of having too many black cats to buck against.</p>

<p>“Pshaw!” says she, getting control of herself so
quickly that it surprised us. “You needn’t act so
sheepish about it. If you want to know the truth,
I’m used to disappointments. A body has to be in
living with Pa. For he’s the most disappointing
person I’ve ever known. He’s a disappointment in
himself and a disappointment in almost everything
he does—except eat. And even then I have to watch
him like a hawk to see that he doesn’t bite chunks
out of the dishes.... Did you see Lawyer Chew in
Neponset Corners?”</p>

<p>“No,” grinned Poppy, “but we saw his son Eggbert.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>“I don’t know him.”</p>

<p>“Well, you haven’t missed much.”</p>

<p>“All the afternoon,” the woman went on, “I have
been in fear and trembling that the sheriff would
come and put us out. But I have seen nothing of
him, nor the lawyer either, for that matter.”</p>

<p>Poppy laughed. But he didn’t take the time just
then to explain why the sheriff hadn’t showed up.</p>

<p>“Any word from the granddaughter?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“Laws-a-me! Wasn’t I expecting you to bring
Miss Ruth home with you? So how could I hear
from her until you got here?”</p>

<p>“I thought maybe she might have telephoned
from Pardyville.”</p>

<p>“She probably will,” came the thought, “now
that she’s waiting there.”</p>

<p>“If she does,” says Poppy, “you can tell her that
we’ll be over to get her the first thing in the morning.”</p>

<p>All he said that for, of course, was to sort of put
the woman at her ease. For he had no idea that
the girl would telephone.</p>

<p>“Did Dr. Madden say anything about the granddaughter
when he was here this evening, Mrs. Doane?”</p>

<p>The woman stared.</p>

<p>“Dr. Madden? Laws-a-me, child, you do say
some <i>silly</i> things. For how could the doctor call
here when he’s in Europe?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>The leader told her then that we had met the
returned doctor on the road.</p>

<p>“I thought, of course, that he had been here to
see you about something or other. But he may have
been coming across from C. H. O.”</p>

<p>We then introduced old Goliath Cassibaum Hopple,
explaining briefly that he was a friend of ours who
wanted to get a bed for the night. We didn’t mention
his family squabbles, for he had asked us not to—it
pained him to talk about the unhappy matter,
he said, with sad eyes, and it pained him even worse
to have others talk about it. To that point, it
was all right, we thought, to keep his secret. It
didn’t hurt Ma any. How her tongue would have
waggled, though, could she have known the truth!
Old Goliath would have squirmed, all right. And it
was just as well that he got out of that.</p>

<p>The doors were open to any friend of ours, came
the warm invitation. But when the housekeeper
got a better look at the visitor, and saw how big he
was, she began to worry for fear that there might
not be a bed in the house half long enough for him.</p>

<p>“Don’t you fret none ’bout me, ma’am,” the giant
told her quickly. “Fur I know how to make myself
comfortable on the floor. In fact, that’s where
my wife makes me sleep the most of the time, anyway—me
and the dawg.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>The dumb-bell! You should have seen Ma stare
at him. And he had been so very particular to
caution us about mentioning his home affairs.</p>

<p>“His wife,” Poppy put in quickly, to smooth
things over, “has some queer notions.” Then he
used his toes on old Goliath’s shins as a gentle little
hint for the other to dry up.</p>

<p>Going in the house, we sure made a wreck of the
grub that Ma had waiting for us. Boy, did potatoes
and gravy ever taste so good! Um-yum! Nor did
Poppy and I shovel in any more hash than old blunderbuss.
<i>He</i> seemed hollow from cellar to garret.
Either his wife had been ladling out too much religion
to him and not enough soup, or there hadn’t
been enough soup to go around.</p>

<p>Supper over, we went out to the barn with our
flashlight, which was working again by spells, to
see how the gander was faring, and finding it asleep
we circled through the grounds to settle our big
supper.</p>

<p>Another queer fancy of the rich man who had built
this place was the fine lawn that he had kept inside
of the stone wall, though beyond the wall, as I have
earlier described, was the contrast of a forsaken
desert. Hundreds of loads of black dirt had been
hauled here to make a bed for the grass, and in
the owner’s lifetime there had been big patches of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
flowers and a swell layout of bushes. I guess you
call it landscape gardening, or something like that.
The grass now was long, with a lot of dead stuff in it,
but even so it wasn’t a bad lawn. Nor had the
bushes gotten ragged in the year that the house had
been closed.</p>

<p>“Jerry,” says Poppy, as we mogged around,
“did you hear what Ma said about the death-chamber
door?”</p>

<p>“No,” says I quickly. “What about it?”</p>

<p>“It didn’t slam to-night at ten o’clock as usual.”</p>

<p>“The ‘ghost’ is scared of us, huh?” I laughed.</p>

<p>“We weren’t here.”</p>

<p>“I know, but we had planned on being here. And
probably the ‘ghost’ knew about it.”</p>

<p>“Pa’s in bed sick.”</p>

<p>“Ah-ha! No wonder the door didn’t slam.”</p>

<p>“Ma says his head has been hurting him all day.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he tried to use it.”</p>

<p>“I feel sorry for that old geezer, Jerry. I honestly
believe that he’s in trouble.”</p>

<p>“Trouble? What kind of trouble?”</p>

<p>“As we know, he’s mixed up in this secret, whatever
it is. And I think that his trouble to-day is
worry. Before we go to bed to-night, suppose we
tell him some of the things we know and offer to
help him. That may bring him out of his shell.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
We’ll have to do it, of course, when Ma isn’t around.”</p>

<p>Ungrateful bums that we were, the idea never
had percolated into our noddles to stay in the kitchen
after eating and help Ma with the late supper dishes.
And finding her deep in the dish pan on our return
to the house, we felt kind of cheap. Thoughtlessness
like that doesn’t get a fellow anything. So,
to sort of square ourselves, we grabbed a couple
of wiping towels and got busy.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Doane,” says Poppy, as he cleverly massaged
the gravy bowl, “did the thought ever come
to you that there might be something sort of questionable
about Mr. Danver’s sudden death?”</p>

<p>A plate fell from the woman’s hands into the dish
water.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” she cried, looking frightened. “Why
do you bring up such a dreadful subject at a time
like this? Yes, if you must know the truth, I <i>have</i>
been worried over Mr. Danver’s death. I have had
strange suspicions. And these suspicions have
troubled and unnerved me more than you can imagine.
Outside of Pa, I’m pretty much alone in the world.
And, as I have told you before, <i>he</i> isn’t much company.
It’s a waste of time talking with him about anything
out of the ordinary. So I never told him about
<i>this</i>. In fact, until now, I never have fully opened
my mind on the subject to anybody. But somehow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
I have a great deal of trust in you boys. And it <i>is</i>
a big comfort to me to have somebody to lean
on.”</p>

<p>“You can lean on us all you want to,” says
Poppy feelingly, as he blotted a saucer. “For we
like it.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” says I, looking into the gray eyes, “and
we like you, too. And if we can help you, we’re
going to do it. Eh, Poppy?”</p>

<p>“You tell ’em,” waggled the other.</p>

<p>“I’ve already told you about the night I looked in
the casket. I was suspicious then about my relative’s
death, for I hadn’t been able to get much out of
Dr. Madden except that the sick man had died
very suddenly. <i>Why</i> had he died? Heart trouble,
I was told briefly. <i>Heart</i> trouble! Every person
who dies has <i>heart</i> trouble. The heart stops beating,
for some reason or other, and that’s the end. I
wanted to know what had <i>made</i> my relative’s heart
stop. But could I pin Dr. Madden down? No,
indeed! He can be as close-mouthed as Lawyer
Chew when he wishes. In fact, they’re a good pair
when it comes to <i>secrecy</i>.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose they’re working together, Mrs.
Doane?”</p>

<p>“Who? Dr. Madden and Lawyer Chew? Laws-a-me,
child! They don’t even speak to each other.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>That put Poppy on his toes.</p>

<p>“Hot dog!” he yipped, flourishing the dish towel.
And then, seeing the woman’s surprise, he went on:
“It’s my hunch, Mrs. Doane, that there’s a sort of
secret bond, or whatever you call it, between this
doctor and the granddaughter. But it didn’t fit
into my theory for two cents to include old fatty.
So you see how tickled I am over what you just
told me.”</p>

<p>“Years ago,” explained the woman, “the two men
had trouble. I don’t know what over. But to
my knowledge they haven’t spoken to each other
since.”</p>

<p>The leader got all screwed up then to spring something
big. I had seen it coming and was prepared
for a surprise. For I knew old Poppy! When it
comes to <i>brain</i> work, I think he’s a wonder.</p>

<p>“Do you know what I think about Dr. Madden’s
trip to Europe, Mrs. Doane?”</p>

<p>“No,” came eagerly, “tell me.”</p>

<p>“Like you, I think that there <i>was</i> something queer
about the old man’s death. I don’t mean, though,”
came hastily, “that either Dr. Madden or Lawyer
Chew are guilty of a crime. No, indeed. Dr.
Madden, I suppose, did all he could to fix up the sick
man. And certainly, if he had suspected that his
enemy was putting across anything criminal, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
would have had the lawyer arrested long before this.
No, that isn’t it. Whatever crooked work Lawyer
Chew is up to, it isn’t poisoning, or anything like
that. Yet there’s a mystery here just as deep.
And it was to clear up this mystery, I think, that
Dr. Madden hurried away to Europe. Now he’s
back. And I’d be willing to bet my hunks of pie
for the next six months against a mosquito’s false
teeth that he’s got things all set to spring a surprise.
And a regular old gee-whacker of a surprise, too.
You say the will is going to be read to-morrow night
at ten o’clock. All right. Dr. Madden will be
here, whether Lawyer Chew invites him or not,
and you and Pa and everybody else in the family are
going to get the surprise of your lives. That takes
in old fatty, too. <i>I</i> think, to further spread around
my ideas, whether they’re bunk or what, that Dr.
Madden is the one who sent for the granddaughter.
Right now he knows where she is, and at the
proper moment she’ll turn up—to undo old Chew,
probably.”</p>

<p>“Laws-a-me!” cried the amazed woman, with a
bewildered face. “You’ll be telling me next that
Dr. Madden is back of the door slamming here, and
all the other queer things.”</p>

<p>Poppy got my eyes for a moment.</p>

<p>“We kind of have an idea who the ‘ghost’ is,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
he grinned. “But for certain reasons we’d rather
not tell you just now.”</p>

<p>He meant old Ivory Dome, of course.</p>

<p>“And is it your idea,” I asked him, when we were
alone, “that the old man has been putting on this
‘ghost’ stuff at the doctor’s orders?”</p>

<p>“That’s exactly what I do think, Jerry. The
three of them—the two men and the girl—are
secretly and peculiarly working together. And
the whole scheme, I bet you, is to undermine old
Chew.”</p>

<p>“Well,” I grinned, “if they do scoop a hole under
old fatty, I hope they make it deep enough so that
he’ll have to do some tall digging himself to get back
where it’s daylight.”</p>

<p>“Dr. Madden knows his stuff, Jerry.”</p>

<p>“So do you,” I grinned. And I meant it, too.</p>

<p>“What puzzles me more than anything else,”
the other then went on, “is the spotted gander.
For the life of me I can’t figure out how it fits into
the tangle, or why it was sent here.”</p>

<p>“Ask Dr. Madden,” I laughed.</p>

<p>“I’m going to,” was the quick reply.</p>

<p>“Yes, you are—not!”</p>

<p>“We’ll forget about Pardyville, Jerry, for in going
there our time would just be wasted. Instead,
we’ll go back to Neponset Corners to-morrow morning.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
And we’ll let Dr. Madden treat us for an
acute case of friendlius-curious-snoopius.”</p>

<p>But instead of going to Dr. Madden to be “treated,”
as Poppy had planned, it was the doctor who came
to the big house, as you will learn in the next
few chapters.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br>

<small>BIT BY A GRAND VIZIER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Ma Doane</span> sure was a worker. The supper dishes
washed and put away in the cupboard, each dish in
its proper place, she got out a little comb-like machine
for making switches. A switch, as you probably
know, if you have any old ladies in the family,
is a tail of false hair. Some oldish women still use
them. It’s a part of their dressing-up scheme.
Camouflage, Dad calls it.</p>

<p>Switch making, we learned, was a sort of side line
with Ma. She earned about a hundred dollars a
year that way. A customer wanting a switch would
save her hair combings, and Ma would take this
tangle of stuff and make it into a switch with the
aid of her home made combing machine. In talking
with her about the work, which interested us at
first, she laughingly told us how she had made wigs
for bald-headed men, too. She wanted us to know,
I guess, as much as anything, that <i>all</i> wearers of false
hair weren’t women!</p>

<p>After watching her for a few minutes, with the
feeling that she was mostly doing this work to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
quiet her mind, or, rather, as a sort of accompaniment
to her tangled thoughts, we went upstairs to
talk with Pa. For that was our plan, you know.
To our surprise, we found the old man smoking in
bed, as chipper as you please. Old Goliath was
there, too, with another pipe. And in their new
friendship if you think the two old geezers weren’t
messing up the air with tobacco smoke you should
have been there to cut off a sample for yourself.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” drawled the runaway, “it’s the nature
of some wimmin to be that way. They just kain’t
help it, I reckon. Not so much temper, I take it,
as temperament.”</p>

<p>“Or <i>dis</i>temper, hey?” cackled the other smoker.</p>

<p>“Exactly. Take my Clarissa fur example. She
just seemed to have a natural hankerin’ fur throwin’
things at me. I didn’t mind cold ’taters so much,
or even soggy dough, though it were blamed oncomfortable
sometimes to git some of it squashed in
my face, especially when I wasn’t lookin’ fur it.
But what I hated worser ’an that, even, was stove
lids an’ flatirons. An’ to make it all the more
onfortunate fur me, Clarissa had a most powerfully
perfect aim.” A big hand parted the brown hair
that hung almost to the giant’s shoulders. “See
that bump? Some of Clarissa’s fine work. An’
that, mind you, is the very spot she aimed for, too.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
Every <i>push</i> with that old gal meant a <i>put</i>. So you
see, Mr. Doane, everything considered, me not
havin’ eyes in the back of my head to pertect me
there, to say nothin’ of gittin’ soaked when I was
asleep in my chair, it weren’t sech a terribly useless
or onreasonable notion of mine to skin out.”</p>

<p>“Ma never throwed stuff at me much,” came the
second henpecked tale, “but her jawin’ apparatus is
the confoundest waggingest an’ most con<i>sistent</i>
thing I ever heerd tell of in all my born days. Talk
about perpet’al motion! One day when her throat
got stopped up so she couldn’t talk I swar to Peter
I thought I’d lost my hearin’. I stand her gab jest
so long an’ then I send her away on a vacation,
so I kin git a rest.”</p>

<p>Poppy nudged me as we stood in the doorway.</p>

<p>“I guess old Pop isn’t so dumb, huh?” says he in
my ear.</p>

<p>We had surprised the old man, all right. And
listening, I was further puzzled over him. Was it a
sort of lifelong game of his, I wondered, to play
dumb in his wife’s eyes? It would seem so, from what
we knew of him and from what we just had overheard.
To hear his wife tell it, he had about as much brains
as a hitching post. But in the right kind of company, as
now, and with his wife out of his sight, he seemed perfectly
able to spread around plenty of fairly intelligent gab.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>How shrewd was this trick of his, I then thought.
By pretending dumbness he saved himself the job of
saying “yes” and “no” all day long as punctuation
marks to his wife’s endless tongue wagging. Furthermore,
he had no managing job as head of the house,
for, of course, not being “all there” in his upper
story, he couldn’t be expected to do much work!
Some men, you know, are lazy enough to jump at any
kind of a scheme to save their backs.</p>

<p>Sort of summing up, I felt that I had a pretty good
line on the tricky old man now. And I liked him the
less for what I knew about him. Here he was
taking it easy—and to that point faithful little old
Ma undoubtedly had lugged his dinner and supper
up to him on a tray!—while downstairs the innocent
one was straining her eyes over a tangle of human
hair to earn money to keep him in smoking tobacco.</p>

<p>Getting sight of us through the smoke screen, the
two old gossips sort of rolled up their gab, as though
they didn’t want us to know too much about their
family affairs, though why old Goliath should act
this way all of a sudden was a puzzle to me, for
certainly, on the way out, he hadn’t been backward
in spilling his grief to us.</p>

<p>Then Ma breezed into the room, jawing to beat the
cars. <i>Such</i> a smoke! What would the curtains
and bedclothes be like? Up went the window ...<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
and out went old Goliath. Not out of the window,
you understand, but out of the room.</p>

<p>We grinned at him as he swung past us into the hall.</p>

<p>“I guess,” he drawled, looking back with a comical
twist to his face, like a spanked kid, “they wasn’t
no false bottom to that story of the old man’s. She
sure <i>kin</i> talk. They’s no ifs or ands about that.
She’s what you call <i>pur</i>-ficient. An’ between rollin’
pins an’ <i>this</i>, I think, fur a life’s job of it, I’d prefer
the rollin’ pins.... Wa-al, where do we bunk?”</p>

<p>“Jerry and I have the notion,” says Poppy—only
it was <i>his</i> notion and not mine—“that we’d like to
sleep in the dead man’s room. Mrs. Doane says
we can. And she’s going to bring quilts and things
for you to sleep on the floor in front of the door, if
that’s agreeable with you.”</p>

<p>Ma was bustling around in the smoke house, getting
ready to go to bed, so Pa was out of our reach for the
night at least. However, it wasn’t important for
us to talk with him right away, Poppy said. He
had lost some of his sympathy for the old geezer,
I guess. And I was glad of that. For it looked like
a crazy stunt to me to show our hand to the tricky
old man, as the other had suggested. He’d have us
at a disadvantage then.</p>

<p>Eleven-thirty found us parked in our bedrooms for
the night, Ma and Pa in their room halfway down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
the long hall, and the three of us in the “master’s
chamber,” as the big room was called. A sweller
bedroom I never hope to see. Say, it was more like
a parlor than a bedroom. Boy, the carpet was so
thick that it tickled our knees. And the bed alone
must have cost a thousand dollars. It was <i>some</i>
bed. Like a king’s. On top of the headboard was
a fancy doo-dad—a sort of red-plush curtain, folded
as slick and pretty as you please, with gold fringe.
And there was more of the same plush stuff over the
windows. The walls were laid out in big panels,
and each panel was a separate picture worked into
cloth. Tapestry—I guess that’s the right word to
use. The ceiling was a big picture of dancing ladies
wrapped in strings of flowers—and bu-lieve me, all
those ladies <i>did</i> have on was flowers! That was an
awful side-show for a man to lay in bed and look at,
I thought, blushing. The chairs had biscuit cushions
and toothpick legs. Further, there was a table, a
swell dresser that matched the bed, a grandfather’s
clock and a writing desk. Everything being new to
us, it was an awful temptation to start snooping.
For one thing, we thought, the desk might be crammed
full of money! Of course, it wasn’t money that we
could take—I don’t mean that—but it would be exciting
to count it. Thousand-dollar bills, maybe. Millionaires
<i>do</i> have thousand-dollar bills. Sure thing.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
And having died very suddenly, the rich man might
not have remembered, as a last act, to send his money
back to the bank. But we didn’t snoop, even though
the thought came to us that among the packages of
greenbacks in the desk we might find a private paper,
or some such thing, that would clear up the crazy
mystery. For Mrs. Doane hadn’t told us that we
could open the desk. Anyway, we couldn’t have
opened it if she had said so, for it was locked.</p>

<p>Poppy spent quite a bit of time examining the clock.
For it was his idea that there might be a pair of
hidden electric wires between the timepiece and the
door. But he could find no wires. And we were
dead sure, too, that there were no hidden springs in
or around the door.</p>

<p>Helping old Goliath make up his floor bed, we
tucked him in and then went to bed ourselves.
The light was out now. And though I wasn’t <i>scared</i>,
still, as I lay there in the dark, I had a queer feeling.
I put my nose against the sheets. They smelt all
right. And just because they were <i>cold</i> didn’t mean
that they had been touched by dead hands. Sheets
were naturally cold, I told myself. Yet somehow
these sheets felt <i>different</i>. Sort of clammy-like.</p>

<p>I got closer to Poppy. If the sheets would only
hurry up and get warm, was my thought. <i>What
was that?</i> Oh!... Goliath had kicked the wall in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
his sleep. I tried to quit shivering. Those blamed
co-old sheets.</p>

<p>“If you want to shimmey,” purred Poppy, kept
awake, “why don’t you get out on the roof where
you’ll have more room?”</p>

<p>“This is a crazy notion,” says I unhappily.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Sleeping here. What good’ll it do us, anyway?”</p>

<p>“You seem to be getting a lot of exercise out of it.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got a notion to get up and sleep with old
Goliath.”</p>

<p>“If he rolls over on top of you in the middle of the
night you’ll wish you’d stayed here.”</p>

<p>“I’d rather be a pancake than an icicle.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to say you’re cold!”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! I’m roasting. Get me a fan.”</p>

<p>“But how can you be <i>cold</i> on a hot night like this?”</p>

<p>“Ask me why porcupines have whiskers.”</p>

<p>“You and your porcupines!”</p>

<p>“Tell me why you want to sleep here,” I pressed.</p>

<p>“For the same reason that a ten-year-old likes to
monkey with the family clock. I’m curious to know
if anything spooky <i>can</i> happen in this room.”</p>

<p>“I’ll never sleep a wink!”</p>

<p>“Kid, you aren’t half as shivery as you try to let
on.”</p>

<p>“What if the spy breaks into the house?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>“Let him. We know who he’s working for. And
at our orders old Goliath will lay him cold.”</p>

<p>“I feel better,” I told him, after a few minutes.</p>

<p>“That’s the stuff,” he encouraged, like the good
pal that he was.</p>

<p>“Shall we go to sleep?”</p>

<p>“Sure thing. For if we don’t we’ll be half dead
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>The sheets were nice and warm now. And how different
I felt! That’s the way it is with a fellow—he
gets shivery one minute and then in another minute
he’s all right again. I rather liked it now. I felt
like a king. What was that story in the <i>Arabian
Nights</i>? Oh, yes! A boy wanted to be king, and
one night the real king, in going around secretly,
heard the boy wishing. And for a joke the boy was
carried in his sleep to the palace where he was put
in the king’s bed. Waking up the next morning, he
was king, all right, just as he had wanted to be! He
was king all that day. Then in the dark they carried
him home again.</p>

<p>That was me. <i>I</i> was king, too. And in the
morning the black eunuchs, or whatever you call ’em,
would come in, bowing and scraping. The Grand
Vizier would come in, too, to find out which of my
six hundred suits I wanted to wear that morning, and
how many prisoners’ heads I wanted cut off before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
breakfast. Maybe I would be asleep when the
Grand Vizier came. He wouldn’t dare to wake me
up, me being king. That is, he wouldn’t dare to
shake the tar out of me as Mother does when she
gets out of patience with me on school mornings.
Still, he might ever so gently touch my royal fingers
as they lay on the solid gold coverlet. And that’s
exactly what he <i>did</i> do! He reached down and
touched my fingers—only it wasn’t my fingers it
was my bare <i>toes</i>. More than that, he <i>pinched</i>.
<i>Good</i> night! Didn’t the dumb-bell know any better
than to pinch the king’s toes? I’d fix him for this.
I’d have his head cut off. And <i>now</i> what was he
doing? Why was he stooping over? Was he going
to <i>bite</i> my toe? Well, of all things! I could see his
white teeth ... and then, as he took hold, I could
<i>feel</i> his teeth.</p>

<p>I woke up to find Poppy shaking me.</p>

<p>“For the love of mud, kid! Why don’t you kick
the house down.”</p>

<p>“The Grand Vizier bit my toe,” I yipped.</p>

<p>“The Grand Vizier! You’ve been dreaming.”</p>

<p>“But my toe hurts. Something <i>did</i> bite it.”</p>

<p>“Urk! Urk!” says a familiar throaty voice beside
the bed. “Urk! Urk!”</p>

<p>The spotted gander! It was in the room. Some
one had mysteriously brought it into the house<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
while we were asleep. And wanting to wake us up,
or so it seemed, it had pecked at the first hunk of
flesh that it had seen hanging out of the bed, which
happened to be one of my bare feet.</p>

<p>Poppy got up then and lit the lamp.</p>

<p>“You better get up, too,” says he in a queer voice.
“For there’s no telling what’s liable to happen next
in <i>this</i> house.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br>

<small>A SCREAM IN THE NIGHT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> putting the gander in our room, was it the
“ghost’s” scheme to sort of show us how helpless
we were in the big spooky house? Not liking the way
we were messing around in his secret affairs, and
finding out things, as to-night, was he trying to
scare us out?</p>

<p>Thoughts like these soon dried up our shivers.
For we knew, all right, who the “ghost” was. Yet
it puzzled us to understand how the old man could
do so much “mystery” stuff without his wife catching
on. She must be an awfully sound sleeper, we
concluded.</p>

<p>As an excuse for getting old Goliath up, we told
him that some one was in the house. But I don’t
think he understood half what we were saying to him.
He was too sleepy. Then we went into the hall, where
we met Ma on her way to the kitchen with an empty
hot-water bottle. She probably didn’t mind parading
around in front of us boys in her nightgown, but I
took it from her actions that it kind of embarrassed
her to put on the show in front of old Goliath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>“Oh, dear!” she cried, glad, I guess, that we
were there to listen to her further troubles. “I
don’t know but what one of you boys had better run
downstairs and telephone for the doctor. For I’m
having the <i>awfullest</i> time with poor Pa. It’s that
tobacco smoke. He’s sick to his stomach.”</p>

<p>Some more of the old man’s trickery, was our
natural thought.</p>

<p>“When was he taken sick?” inquired Poppy.
“After he got up?”</p>

<p>“After he <i>got up</i>? Laws-a-me! I can’t <i>get</i> him up.
That’s the trouble. I tell him he’ll feel better if he
goes outside for a spell. But, no, he won’t listen
to me.”</p>

<p>“And hasn’t he been out of bed at <i>all</i>?” pressed
Poppy, in a queer voice.</p>

<p>“No. He just lays there and groans. Nor has
he let up a single instant since I went to bed with
him.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be jiggered!” cried the tangled leader,
looking at me.</p>

<p>At Ma’s orders we lit the kitchen stove and warmed
some water, which she poured into the rubber bottle.
With this on his stomach, the sufferer gradually
quieted down. Nor could we make ourselves believe,
as we stood over him, that his sickness was put on.
There was real misery in his voice. And his wrinkled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
face was a sort of yellowish-white, like old piano
keys. Such a look couldn’t have been manufactured
for the occasion. We knew that.</p>

<p>Poppy and I were sort of up a tree, as the saying is.
Pa’s stomach ache had upset the whole works for us.
If the old man had been in his room all evening, as
his wife said, then some one else had been secretly
in the house. For certainly the gander couldn’t of
itself have opened and closed doors. No, it had been
brought here. We couldn’t doubt that for a single
moment. And sort of putting Pa out of the
tangle for the present, and suspecting the spy, we
began to wonder, in growing uneasiness, if, after all,
there hadn’t been more deep <i>purpose</i> back of the crazy
stunt than we had first imagined.</p>

<p>“What beats me,” says the leader, as we earnestly
talked the matter over, “is the easy way the spy
slips in and out of the house. Locked doors are the
same to him as open doors. And he seems to be
wise to every little move we make. For instance, if
his work is all on the outside, as we suspected last
night, how could he have known that we were sleeping
in the dead man’s room?”</p>

<p>“It sure is some tangle,” I waggled.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell the world. And <i>you</i>,” he pointed at the
gander, “are the biggest tangle of all.”</p>

<p>“Urk! Urk!” came throatily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>“Wa-al, I swan!” old Goliath came out of a nap.
“Where did that beast come from?”</p>

<p>“It belongs in the barn,” says Poppy. “And if
you can manage to keep awake for a few minutes
longer, to help us take it back, we’ll reward you with
a beautiful celluloid stove poker.”</p>

<p>I had a lot of new stuff in my head as I followed the
others to the barn. As the leader had said, no part
of the tangle was any queerer than the gander itself.
It had been brought to the big house for a secret
purpose, and furthermore it had been carried to our
room for a purpose. But was this really an act of
the enemy, as we had suspected? To take the view
that the unusual gander was a sort of mouthpiece of
the crazy mystery, wasn’t it possible that some one,
more completely hidden to our eyes than the spy, and
more helpless than we suspected, was trying, in a
sort of blind, stumbling way, to lead us into a solution
of the mystery through the almost human-acting
bird itself? And if we kept a close eye on the gander,
in the barn, wouldn’t we be likely to soon find out
who the hidden one was?</p>

<p>This thought was new to both of us. And Poppy
jumped at it when I sprung it on him. Here was
our scheme now: We’d lay low in the barn, close to
the gander, and then, at the least suspicious sound
from the spotted fowl, we’d flash our light. In that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
way neither friend nor enemy could come into the
barn to get the gander for further secret stuff without
us seeing him and thus learning who he was. More
than that, we had a clever little trapping scheme, as
you will learn.</p>

<p>There was a barrel here, and a clothesline. And
how easy it would be, we planned, for one of us to
hide in the barrel and do a trick with the rope through
the bunghole. We worked out all of the details.
Then the leader and I drew cuts to see who would
have the bunghole job, for the barrel was seven sizes
too small for old Goliath. Anyway, we couldn’t
have trusted him alone. He was too much of a sleepy-head.</p>

<p>I got the short straw. That made me “it.” But
I didn’t get <i>into</i> the barrel. To sort of make it safer
for me, I scrooched and let Poppy put the barrel
over me, which gave me a neat roof. Then he tied
the rope across the doorway and threaded the loose
end into the bunghole.</p>

<p>“Now, don’t forget, Jerry. You’re to let the rope
lay flat. I’ll be in the haymow with the flashlight.
And if I hear any queer sounds down here, on goes
the light. See? I’ll yell if I see anybody beating
it for the door. Then you yank on the rope for dear
life.”</p>

<p>“And mister geezer gets tripped up, huh?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>“That’s the dope.”</p>

<p>“But suppose he’s a friend, as I say.”</p>

<p>“Well, we aren’t going to kill him. And I have a
hunch that if we don’t stop him this way he’ll skin
out as quickly as an enemy. For he’s trying to keep
in the dark. So do your stuff with the rope. And old
Goliath and I will be on top of him before he quits
spinning.”</p>

<p>The giant grumbled sleepily as he followed the
leader up the ladder into the haymow. Such monkey-work,
he said, just to keep a gander from being stolen.
If it was such a <i>precious</i> gander, why didn’t we take
it to bed with us? What was the sense of losing all
this sleep for nothing?</p>

<p>But pretty soon the grumbling voice died away.
And how very quiet the barn was now! Like a
tomb. Yet there was plenty of racket where I was,
for the barrel acted like a sounding board for my
galloping heart. THUMP! THUMP! THUMP!
That’s the way it sounded in my ears. Not that I
was scared, though. I just didn’t like being alone.</p>

<p>Squatting under a barrel isn’t the most comfortable
job in the world, let me tell you. I soon found that
out. My bones began to ache. Nor did squirming
around help very much. I thought of Poppy,
stretched out on the haymow floor with his face in the
ladder hole. How comfortable for him! Somehow I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
always did manage to get the unluckiest jobs.</p>

<p><i>What was that?</i> A floor board had creaked. As
though some one had gently put his weight on it.
<i>There!</i> A footfall. No doubt of it. More footfalls.
Each as easy and as guarded-like as you please.</p>

<p>Then deep silence. The deadliest and awfullest
silence I ever had known. What was the matter
with Poppy? Why didn’t he flash the light? Had
he and old Goliath both gone to sleep? It would
seem so.</p>

<p>The gander hadn’t made a peep. So I knew it
was still on its roost. Why didn’t the man grab
it, I thought. I wanted him to. Then maybe it
would squawk loud enough to wake up the gallery.
Poppy sure was a peach to go to sleep at a time like
this. What I’d tell <i>him</i>.</p>

<p><i>Phew!</i> Of all the funny smells. I got my nose
closer to the bunghole. Some kind of a drug-store
smell, I told myself.</p>

<p>The roof creaked over my head. And what do you
know!—the man was sitting on top of my coop now.
It was <i>him</i> I had smelt. Putting a finger through
the bunghole, I found that I could touch his leg.
But you can bet your Sunday shoes that I didn’t
touch him very hard. I guess not.</p>

<p>Ma had told us about “queer smells” in the house.
On the dead man, too. Was this the same smell, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
wondered. One thing, I knew it wasn’t the dead
man himself. For whoever was sitting on my barrel
was a whole lot huskier in weight than a ghost.
Besides, I had touched him. And you can’t touch a
ghost.</p>

<p>More footfalls! And louder ones this time. Some
one else had come into the barn. Oh, if Poppy
would only flash the light! What was the matter with
that kid, anyway?</p>

<p>The man with the drug-store smell wasn’t on the
barrel now. He had slid down. And suddenly
the barn was filled from top to bottom with the awfullest
scream you can imagine. The scared-to-death
kind of a scream. Boy, did my hair ever stand on
end. Then I heard something else—a dull thump
on the barn floor.</p>

<p>“Jerry!” yipped Poppy out of his bed in the moon.
“Yank the rope—<i>quick!</i> The flashlight won’t work.”</p>

<p>Well, I yanked. I yanked good and plenty, let
me tell you. But I guess I was too late. For nothing
skidded into my rope. So, after a few seconds, I
tipped the barrel over and got on my feet.</p>

<p>Poppy had seen me jiggle the crippled flashlight
to make it work. And I could imagine that he
was shaking it now to beat the cars. Pretty soon
he got a connection. And did a light ever look so
good to me as then. Oh, boy!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>Scrambling down the ladder with the light in his
hand, the leader looked to me to be all arms and legs.
Farther up I could see old Goliath’s slow feet. The
light made a round puddle on the floor. It had found
something and stopped. Something white and
long.</p>

<p>“It’s Mr. Doane,” cried the leader, bending over
the body. “Some one knocked him out.”</p>

<p>Yes, sir, the long white thing on the barn floor was
old Ivory Dome himself. He was in his nightshirt,
exactly as I had seen him the night before in the
kitchen. And his face was covered with blood. But
he wasn’t dead, as I first thought.</p>

<p>It was old Goliath who discovered that the gander
was missing. But just then neither Poppy nor I
cared a whang whether the crazy bird had skinned
out of the barn of its own accord or had been stolen.
What we were thinking of instead was the old man.</p>

<p>Carrying him into the house, we washed the blood
from his grizzled hair, as it fringed his bald spot.
The forehead high up had been bruised, as though
from a club swat. Doctoring the bruise as best we
knew how, and putting a bandage on it, we helped
the vacant-eyed one back to bed, where his wife, as
we could see her through the open door, was snoozing
as peacefully as an over-fed kitten.</p>

<p>But she was out of bed the instant her eyes opened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>“Why!... What’s happened to Pa? Has he
had another accident?”</p>

<p>“Hadn’t you missed him, Mrs. Doane?”</p>

<p>“Laws-a-me! Do you think I would have been
lying here if I had <i>known</i> that he wasn’t in bed with
me? Has he been sleepwalking again?”</p>

<p>Poppy didn’t say anything. For that was better,
he thought, than saying too much.</p>

<p>“I knew he’d fall and hurt himself,” the woman
ran on, to her own idea of things. “Oh, dear! Such
a man! Must I strap him in bed hereafter, as they
do with simpletons?”</p>

<p>Neither the leader nor I had asked the old man any
questions about his accident. Nor had he mumbled
more than a word or two all the time we were carrying
him around and doctoring him up. For the most
part he just stared at us, as though his whole brain
had been stunned. Maybe, we thought, realizing
that this was a much worse accident than the first
one, he wouldn’t have to pretend dumbness now.
We hoped, though, that the morning would find him
all right again. Then we’d question him, with Ma’s
help. And certainly we ought to get <i>something</i> out
of him. For he wouldn’t want to hang on to his
secret if the rest of us were liable to get what he got.</p>

<p>As though the night hadn’t been exciting enough for
us, still another surprise jumped at us when we got<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
back to the big bedroom. The desk was open!
And everything in it had been carried away.</p>

<p>A few rifled desks more or less meant nothing in
the sleepy life of old Goliath, who already was snoozing
in a heap on the floor. And after a few minutes,
we, too, stretched out on the bed to get some rest.
But we didn’t figure on going to sleep. After all the
excitement it didn’t seem possible to us that we could.
And to be ready in a jiffy, no matter what bobbed
up, we kept our clothes on, even our shoes.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br>

<small>GETTING CLOSER TO THE SECRET</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Are</span> you all tangled up in the mystery now?
Having read this far, is the cart, in your jumbled mind,
pulling the horse? Or, having carefully chewed up
and digested Poppy’s wild theory, together with the
mess of stuff that led up to that theory, do you have
similar fixed ideas about the millionaire’s death, to
start with, and all the other more or less hitched-together
things, including the granddaughter’s disappearance
and the spotted gander?</p>

<p>What stumped Poppy and I right now was the
sort of <i>contradictory</i> side of the crazy tangle. There
was old Ivory Dome. Having surprised him in the
kitchen, very “ghostlike” indeed in his long white
nightshirt, we had jumped to the natural conclusion
that he was back of all the “spooky” stuff that was
going on in the house. But now we knew differently.
The old man wasn’t the “ghost,” as we had suspected.
He had secrets, of course. And maybe he
knew who the “ghost” was. But it was plain to be
seen, from what had just happened in the barn, that
the two men weren’t pulling together in the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
harness. For if they had been, one wouldn’t have
knocked the other cuckoo.</p>

<p>No, whatever peril there was coiled up, serpent-like,
inside of the queer house, and on its doorsteps,
the old man, instead of being safe in his secrets, had
as much to dodge as either of us. And, as I have
written down in the tail end of the preceding chapter,
it was our scheme to use this as a sort of crowbar
to pry him out of his hole. We had a good excuse
now to get after him, roughshod, if necessary, and
<i>make</i> him tell what he knew. And remembering
how he was tricking his wife with his pretended
dumbness, largely to his own lazy comfort, we didn’t
care a whangdoodle whether, like Mrs. Goliath, she
cleaned up on him with a rolling pin or not. She
couldn’t give him anything that he didn’t deserve.</p>

<p>Yet, until we had the true story, it was interesting
to sort of speculate, detective-like, on his motives
and hidden actions. There was his trip to Pardyville.
Having been sent to town to get the expected granddaughter,
he had come home, hours late, with a
strange spotted gander, now the very center of the
crazy tangle. Meeting the granddaughter, had she
put him wise to the fact that there was a bigger hunk
of peril in the queer house than either he or his wife
had suspected? After his talk with her, did he know
<i>why</i> the death-chamber door slammed every night<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
at ten o’clock, and what made it slam? And was it
due to a scheme of hers that he had lugged home the
spotted gander? Had she given him the gander, in
completing her plans to “disappear,” or had she
told him where to get it, and why he <i>should</i> get it—further,
why he should do all these things and <i>keep
his mouth shut</i>, both on her secrets, as she had handed
them over to him, and on her hiding place?</p>

<p>It was Poppy’s notion that Dr. Madden, in planning
a sort of exposure, had sent for the girl, as her friend.
So old Ivory Dome, in meeting the granddaughter
at the depot, could very well have talked over certain
plans with the returned doctor, too—might even
have gotten the gander from the other man, in fact.
If so, was it a sort of <i>royal</i> gander, or something like
that? And having been brought to America by the
doctor, was it considered a big feature in the hidden
scheme that its owner was secretly working on?—a
scheme, of course, in which old Ivory Dome, like the
granddaughter, was playing an important part.</p>

<p><i>Good</i> night! I’d be thinking next, was the way in
which I checked up on my crazy thoughts, that the
peculiar gander actually had something to do with
the millionaire’s sudden death!</p>

<p>Getting back to more sensible stuff, I followed old
Ivory Dome in my mind, from the time he had
arrived with the gander until his sort of fatal trip<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
to the barn. I couldn’t recall that he had made any
fuss over the gander. And that sort of contradicted
the theory that he had been told to bring it home,
as important, and take care of it. If anything, he
had sort of neglected it. Queer. One thing didn’t
jibe with the other at all. And least of all could I
figure out <i>why</i> the gander had been turned over to
the old man if either the granddaughter or the doctor
wanted to be sure of it.</p>

<p>In further spotting the dumb-acting one in the
tangle, we had it on him that he had done two distinctly
mysterious things since his return from
Pardyville, not including the little side trip that had
kept him on the road until ten-thirty: That same
night he had slipped out of bed to unlock the kitchen
door, craftily letting on, when caught by his awakened
wife, that he was “sleepwalking.” And to-night
he had repeated the stunt, getting as far away from
his bed as the barn. Was he doing this midnight
shirt-tail stuff at the granddaughter’s orders? If so,
what was the big idea? Why did he have to wait
until his wife was asleep to go to the barn? And what
was there out back to draw him, in the first place?
The gander probably. But <i>why</i> all the midnight
secrecy? Further, had he been trying to get out of
the house, to go to the barn, where the gander was,
when I had seen him in the kitchen? Very likely.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
But the locked door had stopped him. And the
reason why he had growled under his breath, when
he heard his wife, was because he knew that all
chances of doing any secret stuff that night were gone.</p>

<p>But to-night he had pulled the trick to his satisfaction.
His wife sound asleep, he had crept out
of the bedroom, very well pleased, no doubt, to find
that the kitchen door was already unlocked for him.
And that he couldn’t have suspected that anybody
else was in the barn ahead of him, least of all a hidden
enemy, was shown by his open actions. The first
man had sort of <i>crept</i> into the barn. On tiptoes.
But old Ivory Dome had stepped in as bold as brass.
Then had come the scream ... and to me this was
the most dizzy part of all. For it wasn’t the old
man who had screamed. No. <i>He</i> had been struck
on the head, as we know, but it was the other man
who had done the screaming. Yet, if you can figure
out any sensible reason <i>why</i> the man with the drug-store
smell should scream, womanlike, as though he
was scared out of his wits, you’re a heap smarter than
me.</p>

<p>And now the gander was gone. The man had it,
of course. But if he had come to the barn purposely
to get it, why had he hung around so long in the
dark? Could it be that he had hid there, as an enemy,
to get a secret crack at the other man? It would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
seem so. But how could he have known that at
midnight old Ivory Dome would put on the usual
shirt-tail parade stuff? And, to repeat, having done
the intended biffing act, why had <i>he</i> screamed, and
not the biffed man, himself?</p>

<p>You can see how puzzling it was for us. Whatever
theory we dug out of our minds, there was something
to <i>contradict</i> it. But of this we were dead sure: Some
one, as mysterious in his hidden movements as any
real ghost could have been, was secretly working in
and around the big house. Yet even there we met
with contradiction. For if the hidden man really
had wanted the gander, as his trip to the barn suggested,
why hadn’t he kept it when he had it earlier
in the evening, instead of putting it in our room?
And knowing that we were in the barn, why had he
risked capture by tagging us there? Again, if he
was so dead eager to put a dent in old Ivory Dome’s
thick skull, why hadn’t he taken the easier and surer
course of biffing the marked man while he was
asleep?</p>

<p>It was Poppy’s further theory that the gander had
been put in our room to get us away, so that the desk
could be secretly cleaned out. And there again
was <i>more</i> contradiction. For if the hidden man
had wanted to work at the desk, why had he followed
us to the barn? Still, was our conclusion, it probably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
hadn’t taken him many minutes to pry open the
desk—only we learned, on getting up, that a key
had been used to open the desk and not a jimmy.</p>

<p>And what had been taken out of the desk? Money?
We had talked excitedly of thousand-dollar bills.
But we really didn’t know that there was any money
in the locked desk. And now that I gave the matter
more thought, realizing how the house had been closed
and thus left at the mercy of tramps, I began to
lose faith in the “money” idea. No, instead of
money, it was secret papers that the man was after.
And so as not to overlook the particular paper that
he wanted, he had taken everything. But how
queer, was my thought here, that he had waited until
the <i>last night</i> before the reading of the will to clean
out the desk! To believe Mrs. Doane’s story of
slamming doors and mysterious footfalls, the “ghost”
of the big house had been secretly at work for more
than a week. Why then had he waited until to-night
to rob the dead man’s desk? A spy of Lawyer
Chew’s, if that theory still held, had he been given
orders at the last minute to grab everything in sight?</p>

<p>If only we could have known all this truck ahead
of time! Then, on spotting the spy in the storm,
we could have made sure about his capture, even to
going after him in a desperate way. And to that
point, with the house open to him, why had he stayed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
outside in the wind and rain? That, too, was puzzling.</p>

<p>There now! If <i>that</i> doesn’t completely tangle you
up, I guess you had better go into the detective business
yourself. But clever as you are, don’t be too
blamed sure of yourself! For a whale of a surprise
may jump out at you in the tail end.</p>

<p>As I say, Poppy and I had no intention of going to
sleep. But when a boy is completely fagged out,
he drops off in spite of himself. And that’s the
way it was with us, though we did a lot of talking
back and forth, as I have just written down in my
own way, before sleep got the best of us. Nor did
we wake up to find our heads in one corner of the big
room and our arms and legs in another, or Goliath’s,
either. In her own room further down the hall, Ma
was bustling around, talking a blue streak, as usual,
so we knew that everything was all right over there—only
we were to learn at breakfast time that the
injured shirt-tail parader, on top of being light-headed,
had itchy spots all over his back.</p>

<p>But Ma wasn’t as much upset over the old man’s
new itchiness, and the disturbing truck that had come
ahead of it, as you might imagine. This was a big
day for the little old lady. Soon now she would know,
in the reading of the will, how the dead man’s property
was going to be dished out. And, bu-lieve me, she
wasn’t bashful about speaking up for herself!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>“One time,” she told us, as she twiddled the bacon
and eggs in the frying pan, “Mr. Danver promised
me the red-plush settee in the hall. For, as I hinted
to him at Aunt Samantha’s funeral, it was a perfect
match for the parlor suit that the other relative left
to me—only this one piece, I dare say, cost twice
as much as all five of Aunt Samantha’s pieces put
together. So I hope he didn’t forget about the settee
when he was making out his will. If only I was
<i>sure</i>, I’d have you boys crate it this morning. Still,
I better wait. For I may get a lot more things than
I figure on.”</p>

<p>Having washed ourselves, Poppy and I skinned up
the back stairs, while we were waiting for breakfast,
to see what we could pump out of the old man.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Mr. Doane,” says the leader,
when we were beside the sick bed. “Feeling better
to-day?”</p>

<p>The squirming invalid looked at us with eyes that
didn’t seem to see us.</p>

<p>“Heh?” he fumbled vacantly, moving over in
bed so that he could scratch his itchy back on a
corner of the headboard.</p>

<p>“How’s your head?” says Poppy.</p>

<p>“Heh?” with more back scratching.</p>

<p>“Ah!... Come out of it. We know you aren’t
as dumb as you let on.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>“Heh?” as the itchy one tried the other corner
of the headboard for a change.</p>

<p>“Tell him to put on a new record,” I grinned.</p>

<p>“Did you know,” Poppy then tried to catch the
old man by surprise, “that Miss Ruth is downstairs?”</p>

<p>But the only answer that we got was a dumb and
itchy “Heh?” So we gave it up. For you can’t
squeeze water out of a sponge when the sponge is
petrified.</p>

<p>“Say, Mrs. Doane,” says Poppy, during breakfast,
“do you have a key to the desk in the room
where we slept last night?”</p>

<p>“What! <i>Me</i> have a key to the desk where Corbin
Danver kept his private papers? Laws-a-me, <i>no</i>!
Why do you ask that?” Then, in sudden stiff
suspicion: “Have you boys been snooping in that
desk?”</p>

<p>“No,” says Poppy truthfully. Then he asked
further. “Who has the key?—Lawyer Chew?”</p>

<p>“Outside of what keys you see here in the doors,
the rest, from all over the house, were sent to Miss
Ruth by registered mail.”</p>

<p>“Who mailed the keys to her?—Lawyer Chew?”</p>

<p>“No, Dr. Madden.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he kept out one or two.”</p>

<p>“I can’t say that he didn’t, but I don’t believe it.
For he was too loyal a friend of my dead relative’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
to fail, in the smallest way, to carry out the dying
man’s final wishes.”</p>

<p>“Then you think Miss Ruth has the desk key?”</p>

<p>“She sent me a few keys, when she wrote and asked
me to come here and open up the house for her. I
imagine she has all the rest, the desk key included.”</p>

<p>“Can you think of any reason,” Poppy then
sprung the question, “why she should send some one
here, with the key, to rob the desk just before her
grandfather’s will was read?”</p>

<p>Staring, the woman started to say something,
to better get the leader’s meaning, I imagine. Then,
on a call from above, she dropped her breakfast and
flew up the stairs to the sick room, where the unlucky
invalid, in trying to doctor his itchy back,
had gotten the ammonia bottle by mistake. From
the way he was yipping and dancing around, his
back was the next thing to being on fire, I guess.</p>

<p>Dr. Madden was called at nine o’clock, for the
sick man was in bad shape now, and when
Poppy and I learned that the family doctor was
already on his way to the big house, having left his
own home before eight o’clock, we had the jumpy
feeling that something big was getting ready to drop.</p>

<p>While we were waiting, eager-like, for the doctor
to drive in, the leader and I went to the barn. The
gander was gone, all right. There was no doubt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
about that. In looking around for possible clews,
we discovered a small room, without windows, that
seemed to be a sort of storage place for empty bottles,
the most of which were of the same size and shape.</p>

<p>“Phew!” gagged Poppy, pulling a cork. “Smells
like rotten eggs.”</p>

<p>Getting a whiff, I quickly took down several bottles,
smelling of them one after another, convinced now
that we were getting closer to a solution of the mystery.
For here was the same smell that had come to
me through the bunghole!—and probably the same
smell that Mrs. Doane had noticed in the house,
and on the dead man!</p>

<p>Poppy was excited when I told him. Then, in
further quick detective work, we made the most
amazing discovery of all.</p>

<p>Shoved into a dark corner of the room was a
corrugated-paper box filled with bottles that hadn’t
been opened. There appeared to be a dozen of the
bottles, all packed carefully in excelsior. The
liquid, we saw, taking a bottle into the light, was red,
like blood. But what excited us, more than the
discovery of the filled bottles, was the name on the
box cover. Here it is:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Dr. A. J. Neddam</span>,<br>
Sandy Ridge,<br>
Illinois.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>Do you catch on! NEDDAM was MADDEN
turned around. And more, there was a shipping
date marked on the box which showed that the
package had been taken out of the express office
and brought here in June ... not the June <i>before</i>
the millionaire had died so suddenly, but the last
June on the calendar.</p>

<p>How could Dr. Madden, in ordering the medicine
under a hidden name, and to probably secret purposes,
have brought it here when he was in Europe?
The answer was, of course, that he hadn’t been in
Europe at all! And with his own Neponset Corners
home closed, it was as plain as the nose on our
face—or should I say noses?—that he had been
secretly living <i>here</i>.</p>

<p>So <i>he</i> was the “ghost!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br>

<small>IN QUARANTINE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Boy</span>, were we ever excited! And did we ever feel
like yipping out a string of “Hip-hip-hurray-for-our-side”
stuff! For now, as you can see, we had
the cat by the tail. And soon it would be eating
out of our hands—meaning the whole cat, of course,
and not just its tail.</p>

<p>Yes, sir, clever little sleuthing doo-dads that we
were, we had the goods on old “Mr. Ghost.” And
to think that the mysterious “spook” was the one
man in the tangle whom we hadn’t even suspected!
However, that wasn’t anything against our work.
For not the slightest thing had bobbed up to hint
to us that the family doctor wasn’t in Europe, as
everybody in the neighborhood believed.</p>

<p>Here is the dope as we had it spread out in our
minds now: To solve the secret that clouded the
millionaire’s death, and probably to please the
dying man, the loyal family doctor had hidden himself
for a year in the closed house. There was deep
mystery in his actions, of course, but he would clear
that up. Sharing certain unusual secrets with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
dead man, and an enemy of the scheming lawyer’s,
he had kept in touch with the granddaughter, and
now was working with her, to fix it so the lawyer
couldn’t do any cheating stuff.</p>

<p>It was puzzling, of course, to understand why the
hidden man, in his friendly work, had slammed
doors to scare the two old people away, when the
granddaughter, whom he was helping, had sent them
here. But that wasn’t anything. Maybe a queer
broken brain, before it turned cold, had given the
hider his orders. Certainly, the “queer smell”
was easily explained. Every time the man went
through the hall he had left a trail behind him, just
as I had noticed the smell when he was roosting on
my barrel coop.</p>

<p>But more puzzling than anything else—<i>contradictory</i>,
even—was old Ivory Dome’s swat on the
head. You can see what I mean. If the two men
and the girl were secretly working together, why had
one of the men soaked the other as though he wanted
to lay him cold? And that stormy night, why had
the hidden one left the house, of which he seemed
to have secret ways of getting in and out? Further,
where did the crazy gander come in under the new
order of things and who really had it?</p>

<p>Bu-lieve me, we were on our toes now for the
strange doctor to show up. Not that we expected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
to corner him with our dope. But we had a hunch
that the time was come for him to drop his game of
hide and seek and put all the cards in plain sight on
the table. That probably was why he was coming
here this morning.</p>

<p>Gimlet eyes that always were creeping around in
search of “something!” We’d find out now what
that “something” was, for it had been found—the
secret of the millionaire’s death had been solved.
We were dead sure of that.</p>

<p>But it wasn’t to be our luck to see the strange
doctor that morning. And how we missed him,
when he called at the big house, was a crazy mess,
and goes to show how Fate can make a monkey out
of a fellow and change his soup into sour vinegar.</p>

<p>There was a door to this room that we were in,
with a heavy self-catch on the outside. And swung
shut by the wind, which had come up with the sun
and now was twisting the whole sandy countryside
out of shape, we seemed to be as completely imprisoned
as though our “cage” had been made of
steel instead of heavy boards.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be jiggered!” came Poppy’s much-used
expression, when he found that the door had latched
itself on the outside, where we couldn’t reach
it.</p>

<p>“Phew!” I gagged, holding my nose with one hand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
and feeling around in the dark with the other. “Open
the ventilator—quick!”</p>

<p>“The ‘ventilator’s’ closed, Jerry.”</p>

<p>“Go on!”</p>

<p>“Honest. I can’t budge it.”</p>

<p>I laughed then. I thought it was a good joke on
us. For I never <i>dreamed</i> that we couldn’t jimmy the
latch and quickly get out. But we learned in the
next twenty or thirty minutes that the man who
had hung this door had put it up for keeps.</p>

<p>Still, we <i>had</i> to get out. For having broken one
of the filled bottles in kicking around in the dark,
the gaggy drug smell was getting thicker every minute.
We tried throwing our double weight against the door.
That made it crack. Pretty soon we were panting
from the hard work, with the sweat doing canal
stuff down our necks. But we kept on. And finally
the door went down, with the two of us sprawled
on top of it like a pair of four-legged octopuses.</p>

<p>Cooling off for a minute or two, we ran to the house,
where Ma Doane met us mysteriously at the kitchen
door.</p>

<p>“Sh-h-h-h!” she breathed, with a finger to her
thin lips.</p>

<p>Poppy let out his neck toward the inner rooms.</p>

<p>“Is the doctor here?” he inquired eagerly, though
in a careful voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>“That’s what I want to talk to you about,” and
the housekeeper quietly closed the doors leading
into the adjoining rooms. Facing us, I saw now
how big her eyes were. “I don’t want your friend to
hear me,” she explained, meaning old Goliath,
“for I find that he runs and tells everything in the
sick room. And Pa isn’t to know about this until
to-night, so the doctor said.”</p>

<p>“Know about what?” came quickly from Poppy.</p>

<p>“That all he’s got is the hives and indigestion.
You see, Lawyer Chew is liable to bring the sheriff
here any minute to put us out. And when Dr.
Madden learned of the predicament I was in, he and
I together worked out a scheme to temporarily
keep the lawyer away.” The gray eyes sort of
twinkled now. “The doctor isn’t quite ‘sure’
about Pa’s case. See? And to be safe—for it
might be very contagious, you know!—he tacked up
a quarantine sign on the front door. So now, if
the sheriff comes, we have only to show him the
sign and tell him to scoot.”</p>

<p>“Hot dog!” laughed Poppy, thinking of how old
fatty would huff and puff in his defeat. “Where
is the doctor, Mrs. Doane?—upstairs?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s gone.”</p>

<p>For an instant the leader looked blank.</p>

<p>“Gone!” he squeaked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>“He didn’t stay here more than ten or fifteen
minutes.”</p>

<p>“But we thought he had come to clear up the
mystery.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think he knows half as much about this
mystery as you boys imagine.”</p>

<p>Poppy looked at me.</p>

<p>“Shall we tell her, Jerry?”</p>

<p>“I think we ought to,” I waggled.</p>

<p>This talk stirred up the woman’s curiosity.</p>

<p>“You boys act as though you have a secret,”
she leaned forward.</p>

<p>“Not only one,” laughed Poppy, “but a whole
case of ’em.” Then he added, with a curious
look at the woman: “Didn’t your smeller put you
wise to anything about the doctor, Mrs. Doane?”</p>

<p>“My <i>smeller</i>? What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you notice that his clothes had a sort of
<i>queer</i> smell?”</p>

<p>“No-o,” came with a slow shake of her head.</p>

<p>“And you didn’t smell anything on him that made
you think of—of something else?”</p>

<p>The same answer was given.</p>

<p>“What do you know about Dr. Madden,” the
question was then put to us, “that you should speak
of him so queerly?”</p>

<p>But Poppy wasn’t ready to answer that yet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>“And you’re positive,” he hung on, “that the
doctor’s clothes didn’t have a queer smell?—a sort
of <i>drug-store</i> smell?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t put my nose <i>on</i> him,” came stiffly, “but
I smelt nothing when I stood beside him.”</p>

<p>Poppy dropped that point.</p>

<p>“All right. We’ll take it for granted that he had
on other clothes.... Did he say anything about the
granddaughter?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I think he was disappointed not to find
her here.”</p>

<p>The leader gave me a quick wink.</p>

<p>“But if he and the girl aren’t mixed up together,
as I told you last night, how did he know she was
coming here? You say it’s a secret.”</p>

<p>“Why!...” the woman stared. “I hadn’t thought
of that.”</p>

<p>“You say he was disappointed not to find the
granddaughter here,” Poppy went on. “Do you
mean he was <i>surprised</i>?”</p>

<p>“Ye-es. He acted both surprised and disappointed—almost
troubled, in fact. And from words that
he dropped offhand I got the impression that he
wanted to talk with her about something important.
I told him that so far as we knew she was hiding in
Pardyville. And thinking I might corner him, and
thus prove the truth of your theory, I says: ‘Possibly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
Doctor, you know <i>where</i> she is hiding.’ But
all I got was a stare of surprise. ‘I wish,’ says he
earnestly, ‘that I did know where she is. For it is
very important that we find her to-day. And
taking your tip, I shall drive over to Pardyville
myself and see if I can locate her.’ Then we put
up the quarantine sign and he drove away.”</p>

<p>Poppy wasn’t so sure of himself now.</p>

<p>“And you really believe, Mrs. Doane,” says he,
puzzled, “that the doctor is dumb on where the girl
is?”</p>

<p>“Remembering his earnest words and actions,
I cannot doubt it for a moment.”</p>

<p>We then told the woman about our discovery in
the barn. And while we were talking, the sound of
hoofs and steel buggy wheels came to us from the
graveled drive, as on the preceding day. Running
to the front door, we got a glimpse of young fatty,
driving his father’s rig, while on the small half of
the seat sat a tall, rangy man with a mean-looking
star pinned on his vest.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br>

<small>A WHISPERING VOICE</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">It’s</span> Lawyer Chew’s rig,” says Mrs. Doane, with
a puzzled look at the newcomers.</p>

<p>“Yes,” says Poppy, “and the sort of near-human-looking
object that you see squashed on the seat
behind the whip socket is Lawyer Chew’s pet son,
Eggbert.”</p>

<p>“He looks like his father.”</p>

<p>“And <i>acts</i> like him, too, you’ll find.”</p>

<p>It didn’t take young fatty as long to untangle
himself from the buggy seat as his old man. And,
say, did he ever strut it off as he came toward the
house! The king had arrived! You tell ’em! And
now, at a snap of his royal fingers, everybody and
everything in the landscape, not on his side, would
do a neat and obedient little loop-the-loop.</p>

<p>Yah, he had us licked in his own mind even before
he got out of his pa’s spraddle-wheeled buggy. But
don’t weep too soon over our sad fate. For you
may find that there’s a laugh coming yet.</p>

<p>Chuckling, Poppy pulled me back out of sight.</p>

<p>“Quick, Jerry!—to the kitchen.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>“What for?”</p>

<p>“To find a pail.”</p>

<p>“What kind of a pail?”</p>

<p>“Any kind,” came the giggle, “just so long as it
holds water. And the more water the better.”</p>

<p>“Hot dog!” says I, seeing fun ahead. “Are you
going to give young fatty a shower bath?”</p>

<p>“Nothing else but.”</p>

<p>In a jiffy we had a pail. Not a skinny one, either,
but a sort of robust, full-grown pail. Just fatty’s
size. And filling it with cold water, we hoisted it
up the stairs, for it was the leader’s scheme to do the
“showering” act through an upper window.</p>

<p>So that we would be completely out of sight, we
went clear up to the third floor. Nor did our window
give us away with any squeaky stuff when he guardedly
opened it.</p>

<p>“Reserved seats,” grinned the leader, rubbering
over the sill.</p>

<p>Below us, the over-fed rooster was still doing his
cock-a-doodle-doo stuff.</p>

<p>“My name’s Chew,” we heard him give out importantly
in front of Mrs. Doane. “I guess you
know who my father is, for he was here yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” says the little old lady calmly, “I know a
great deal about your father. And I knew your
<i>grandfather</i>, too, whom you resemble, <i>in your actions</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
a great deal more than you probably realize.”</p>

<p>But fatty didn’t get that.</p>

<p>“My father has me help him, so that I can learn
the business,” came importantly. “And he sent
me over here to lock up this place, and see that it is
kept locked up.”</p>

<p>“Was he <i>afraid</i> to come himself?”</p>

<p>“Afraid? Of <i>you</i>?” and the fat smart aleck gave
the meanest laugh you can imagine. Boy, he sure
was trying to act hard-boiled! “No,” came the
further strut, “he wasn’t <i>afraid</i>. He had other
business that was more important.... You’ve got
just ten minutes to get your stuff packed. And if
you aren’t ready to beat it then, the sheriff here will
do a clever little trick to help you along. Savvy?”</p>

<p>This brought the man forward.</p>

<p>“The boy’s a bit blunt, ma’am,” came in a not
unkindly voice. “Yet he has stated the case correctly.
Unless you promptly leave here of your
own accord, I’ll have to serve the papers on you that
were given to me for that purpose.”</p>

<p>“I suppose,” says Mrs. Doane stiffly, “that in
planning to move us out of here, you even brought
along an ambulance stretcher.”</p>

<p>“An ambulance stretcher? What for?”</p>

<p>“My husband is sick in bed. We had the doctor
for him this morning. And while it probably isn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
a case of <i>smallpox</i>, still the doctor thought it would
be wise to put up a quarantine sign. You might
not have noticed it.”</p>

<p>“I swan!” exclaimed the man, getting his eyes on
the sign. Then he turned to the kid. “Guess,
Sonny, this changes things considerable.”</p>

<p>“It’s a trick!” danced young fatty. “Don’t let
her fool you.”</p>

<p>After a look at puggy-nose, which showed plainly
enough what she thought of him, the woman turned
to the officer.</p>

<p>“There’s a ’phone in the house,” says she. “And
if you wish, you can call up Dr. Madden of Neponset
Corners and verify my story. Or,” dryly, “if you
care to run the risk, you can go up to the sick room
and see the invalid for yourself. But if he coaxes
you to scratch the purple blotches on his back, please
don’t do it. For, as I just told you, it may be catching.”</p>

<p>The man was eager enough to get away.</p>

<p>“Your word’s good with me, ma’am,” says he,
backing off.</p>

<p>But bulldog-face wasn’t going to give up his bone
without a scrap.</p>

<p>“Dumb-bell!” he screeched. “Don’t you know
your onions? It’s a trick, I tell you. And if you
don’t call her bluff, and put her out of here, my
father’ll fix you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>The man didn’t like that, but he hung onto his
temper.</p>

<p>“Servin’ papers on smallpox cases hain’t in my
line, Sonny,” says he quietly.</p>

<p>“Smallpox, your granny!... I’m going in and
’phone, if you don’t.”</p>

<p>“Help yourself,” drawled the officer, giving the
kid the same kind of a look that Mrs. Doane had.</p>

<p>Fatty had talked brave. But he backed down now.
For it suddenly percolated into his thick skull, I
guess, that the woman might be telling the truth,
after all. Anyway, he didn’t go inside to use the
telephone.</p>

<p>The sheriff had gone back to the buggy, as though
the morning’s work was over so far as he was concerned.
This gave us the very chance we were looking
for. But as I grabbed the pail of water, to heave it
out of the window in good aim, Poppy stopped me.</p>

<p>“Look, Jerry!”</p>

<p>He was pointing to the eaves over our heads.
And what do you know if there wasn’t a hornets’
nest up there, under the roof edge, as big as a tub.
It had more holes in it than Red Meyers has freckles,
and there was a pa and ma hornet and nine frisky
little hornets with brand new stingers and sassy
tempers for every hole. Boy, were we ever in luck!</p>

<p>Down below, fatty was spreading around some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
more of his mean gab. His father would see about
<i>this</i> and his father would see about <i>that</i>. Quarantine
sign or no quarantine sign, his father would blub-blub-blub-blub!</p>

<p>Poppy slid the stick out of the bottom part of the
window shade.</p>

<p>“Get ready, Jerry. When I count ‘three,’ dump
your bucket. And at the same time I’ll poke the
nest loose.”</p>

<p>The sheriff had his eyes on us now. But though
he saw what we were doing, he didn’t give us away.
It tickled him, I guess, to see smarty get it in the
neck.</p>

<p>“One, two, <i>three</i>,” says Poppy, and down went
the water and the hornets, only the water, being the
heaviest, hit the fat target first. Doused from head
to foot, young fatty gave a gurgle like a staggering
bull when the nest pancaked on his dome. He knew,
of course, that it was a trick. And looking up to
see where the water and nest had come from, he found
twenty-seven million homeless hornets swooping
down at him in vengeance. One old gladiator, who
could pump his wings faster than the others, made a
swish with his sword, ramming it clear through the
upturned pug nose. Then, boy, oh, boy, did hunky
ever howl! He took to his heels, swinging his arms
over his bean like a drunken windmill. But he wasn’t
fast enough to get away from another old lunker, who
stabbed him six inches deep in the tight part of his
pants. With one great and mighty howl, the runner
jumped clear over a nine-foot bush. Anyway, it
was a bush.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>Closing the window, we scooted downstairs.</p>

<p>“Laws-a-me!” laughed Mrs. Doane, getting her
eyes on our empty pail. “Was it you boys who
threw the water? I never saw anything so funny,
and so <i>appropriate</i>, in all my life. And those <i>hornets</i>!”
Then, grimly: “My only regret is that it
wasn’t Lawyer Chew, himself, who got it, instead
of his son.”</p>

<p>It was going to eleven o’clock now. We had dinner
an hour later, then Poppy and I fixed up the door
in the barn as best we could, for we had no right to
smash it down and go off and leave it that way.</p>

<p>We did a lot of talking back and forth as we worked.
But I don’t know as I need to write it all down.
You know everything that we knew. And probably
the things that puzzled us are puzzling you. It
was a big disappointment to us that we had missed
seeing Dr. Madden. In spite of our discoveries in
the barn, Mrs. Doane didn’t believe that he was deep
in the mystery. But we did. It wasn’t anything
that he hadn’t smelt druggy when he made his
morning call. Clean clothes and a bath could have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
fixed him up O. K. As for acting worried over the
“lost” granddaughter, that could have all been put
on. Or even if he <i>didn’t</i> know where she was, that
in no way left him out of the tangle. Not by a long
shot. Wherever the girl was, or whatever her secret
ideas were in hiding—on him, possibly, as well as
on the rest of us—he had yet to tell <i>why</i> he had hid
himself in the closed house for a whole year.</p>

<p>He would be back in the evening, he had told Mrs.
Doane. Sure thing, he would be back! Just as
Poppy had said in dishing out his theory, it was the
hider’s scheme, in having solved the mystery of the
millionaire’s death, to spring a surprise when the
will was read. So now, as you can imagine, we were
crazy for night to come. For we wanted to find
out <i>why</i> the dead man’s loyal friend had hid in the
lonely house, with queer-smelling drugs all around
him, and what he had uncovered.</p>

<p>Poppy took it into his head to do some more
sleuthing in the upper rooms, hopeful, I guess, that
he would pick up a clew in the way of a cuff link,
or something like that, as usually happens in detective
stories. I saw that he didn’t need me, and going
downstairs to help Mrs. Doane, who was sweeping
and dusting for dear life, so that everything in the
house would be spick and span for the big party that
night, I found her at the telephone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>“What? I can’t hear a word you say.” She
jiggled the receiver hook. “Speak louder, please.
What? Dr. Madden? What did you say? Dr.
Madden <i>what</i>?... No, all I can hear is ‘Dr. Madden.’
Just a minute,” and trembling like a leaf,
she partly turned and motioned to me. “There’s
a boy here, and I’ll let him talk. Maybe he has
sharper ears than me.”</p>

<p>The receiver switched hands.</p>

<p>“It’s long distance,” she told me nervously.
“And I <i>think</i> it’s Pardyville, but I’m not certain.
Oh, dear! How helpless people do get when they
grow old. I hope it isn’t bad news. If the call <i>is</i>
from Pardyville, no doubt the doctor has found Miss
Ruth. And certainly <i>that</i> isn’t bad news.”</p>

<p>“Hello,” says I, jamming the receiver against one
ear and prodding a finger into the other, as I had
seen Dad do on long-distance calls. “Who’s speaking?”</p>

<p>“This is the St. Elizabeth hospital at Pardyville,”
came a faint distant voice. “Can you hear me?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” says I.</p>

<p>A hospital! That wasn’t a very favorable start,
I thought, for good news. We never had <i>dreamed</i>
that the granddaughter, in getting into some kind of
a possible accident, had been taken to a hospital.</p>

<p>“We have an accident case here—Dr. Madden of
Neponset Corners. Do you know him?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>“Yes,” says I, with my heart thumping.</p>

<p>“His automobile turned turtle a mile outside of
town, and he is quite seriously injured. Knowing
that he might not survive the operation, he wants
to talk with Mrs. Ivor Doane. It must be important,
for he insists on doing the talking himself, though he
is in a very weakened condition. Is Mrs. Doane
there?”</p>

<p>“I’m taking the message for her,” I explained.</p>

<p>“Then listen carefully.”</p>

<p>There was a metal-like click at the other end of
the wire; then a short deep silence. My heart was
pounding. I don’t think I ever was more excited
in all my life. Realizing that he was done for,
the queer doctor was going to make a confession
that would clear up the mystery. I was going to
hear strange things. But I didn’t let my excitement
tangle up my wits. I needed a clear brain now. I
realized that.</p>

<p>“This is—Dr. Madden,” came a whispering voice
over the wire.</p>

<p>“Yes?” says I, sort of breathless-like.</p>

<p>“Tell Mrs. Doane—that Ruth Danver will lose—her
grandfather’s property—if she isn’t in the house—before
midnight—to-night. Diary in clock—explains
everything. I found it—and hid it there. Do you—hear
me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>“Yes,” says I.</p>

<p>“The clock—in Mr. Danver’s room. Do you
understand?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” says I.</p>

<p>There was a dead silence then. The whispering
voice was gone. And I knew what that meant.
Without getting a chance to be operated on, the
man was gone, too.</p>

<p>I started to shiver. I don’t know why, unless it
was like having a man die in front of me, sort of.
Things like that get the best of a boy. But after a
minute or two I was all right again. I told Mrs.
Doane about the accident and the whispering voice.
Then we ran upstairs to find Poppy and get the diary
out of the clock.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br>

<small>THE DIARY IN THE CLOCK</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> found Poppy in the big bedroom, doing detective
stuff with a yardstick. But whatever his job
was, he dropped the work in a hurry when I told
him about the whispering voice on the telephone.</p>

<p>Everything was dark inside of the big floor clock.
So we got the flashlight, which was working again,
the leader having cleverly touched it up. The light
helping us to see, we found a leather-covered book
in the very bottom of the clock, sort of tucked away
in a dark corner. It had D-I-A-R-Y printed on it
in gold letters, and under the printing was the dead
man’s name.</p>

<p>“Corbin Danver’s diary!” cried Mrs. Doane, acting
as though she was afraid to touch the book. “Is
it right for us to read it?” she held off, in her nervous
way.</p>

<p>“From what Jerry tells us,” says Poppy, “I take
it that we’ve <i>got</i> to read it. For if Miss Ruth is
liable to lose out on getting this property, as Dr.
Madden said, we want to help her—that really was
his idea in calling us up. And how can we help her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
unless we know what the mix-up is all about?”</p>

<p>That was talking horse sense, all right. So we
took the diary to the window, for better light, and
got busy on it, finding that it went back more than
twenty years.</p>

<p>The most of the writing, we found out, in skimming
through the book, was sort of unimportant. So,
instead of telling you everything, word for word, I’ll
pick out just the <i>mystery</i> stuff.</p>

<p>Stopping in Africa on a trip around the world, a
traveling companion of the millionaire’s had picked
up a fatal jungle disease, like leprosy, and had been
buried there.</p>

<p>“I find myself wondering,” the rich man wrote in
his book, “if I, too, might not contract this fulsome
disease. Poor Travis! Would that I had been able
to trek his body back to civilization.... I shall
watch my hands carefully for any sign of those
fatal white blotches.”</p>

<p>Then, shortly after the globe trotter had come back
to America:</p>

<p>“In Boston I met Dr. Arthur Madden, as fine a
young gentleman, and as ardent a scholar in his
chosen work, as was his father before him, than whom
I probably never will have a dearer or more trustworthy
friend. Out of medical college less than a
year, young Madden is specializing in diseases of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
the skin and flesh. So, thinking it might interest
him, I told him the story of poor Travis. Readily
placing the disease in his mental catalog of human
ailments, domestic and foreign, and much concerned
over the fact that I had been over the same ground
with Travis, he examined my hands so searchingly
as to first make me nervous. But when he asked
to see my <i>feet</i>, my native humor asserted itself.
More than a year having passed since Travis’ death,
does this young scholar imagine that I still am liable
to come down with the disease? He talked so learnedly
of <i>latent germs</i>, that I was inwardly amused, the
more so as I contrasted his rather flowery science
with that of his father, a staid practitioner of the
older school of medicine.”</p>

<p>We skipped two years here.</p>

<p>“I had a letter to-day from young Madden, who
has buried himself (along with his germs!) in a little
country town by the name of Neponset Corners.
In his research work, he is eager to build a country
sanitarium, for patients of ‘incurable’ skin diseases.
This letter, I fancy, is somewhat of an invitation
for me to back his scheme financially. Well, I shall
see what the young man is doing down there when I
visit him next month, as he has urged me to do.
Lately I haven’t been feeling at my best, and I shall
enjoy the quiet of the country.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>A skip of two months.</p>

<p>“These have been hours of the deepest mental
torture to me. Nor has Madden incorrectly diagnosed
my case, as I had so hoped in the beginning.
The white blotches on my right leg, that meant
nothing to me when I first came here, have daily
become more pronounced.”</p>

<p>Another skip.</p>

<p>“I feel that I owe my life to Madden. There can
be no doubt of the miracle that his drugs have worked
in me. My end is not to be as tragic as poor Travis’!
Madden’s faith in germs is more profound than ever.
My malady is under medical control, he tells me, but
the <i>germs</i> are still in my system, as they have been
since Travis and I were simultaneously infected in
the jungle. They may forever lie dormant in my
blood vessels, if I keep myself physically fit, as I
was abroad. Yet to-morrow, if I let myself run down,
they may take a deadly grip on me. Of necessity,
I shall remain very close to this good friend of mine,
so that he may ever be quickly available, in case I
need him, which, of course, I pray that I shall not.
Then, too, he is not without hope that a drug may be
compounded that will completely exterminate the
germs. So, as anxious as I am to remain here, it
also is something of a duty to science for me to stay.”</p>

<p>A skip of three years here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>“My son, Harold, is quite incensed over this country
building project of mine. It is his fear, I think, that
I am getting childish, and thus proving incapable of
managing my own affairs. Yet, could he but know
the truth, how different would be his attitude toward
me! I feel, though, that the isolation that the
country place will afford is highly advisable, notwithstanding
the fact that Madden has repeatedly assured
me that the communication of this disease, except
at its native source, is possibly only through blood
transfusion. How fortunate that I am not a peril
to those around me! Yet, even so, I shrink from
having my malady known. And having pressed
Madden to secrecy, it is my plan to keep even my
own son in ignorance of my condition until I can go
to him completely cured.... This place that I am
planning to build is going to cost heavily. But in
the three years and more that I have been living
here with Madden, both to my own welfare and in the
possible interests of science, the money from my wide
investments has been accumulating far beyond my
ability to use it. So it is well, all things considered,
that I proceed with my plans.”</p>

<p>Another skip of two months.</p>

<p>“It seems that my recent purchase of the sandy
tract north of the river, where extensive building
operations are already under way, has earned for me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
the local reputation of being ‘cracked!’ Yet I
smile at these stories. Only Madden and I know the
truth! Harold, I understand, has a baby girl.
But he has not written to me. I rather prefer,
though, to have our quarrel stand. And to that point
I dare say my daughter-in-law, after what I purposely
said to her, will forever bear me malice, that
being her nature.”</p>

<p>A skip of a month.</p>

<p>“My granddaughter’s name is Ruth Louise. I find
myself longing to see this new mite of humanity, in
whom, some day, will be vested the combined fortunes
of our entire household.”</p>

<p>A skip of two years.</p>

<p>“At last I am in my new home. And knowing how
advisable is the isolation, very peaceful and contented
I find myself here. Yet, to that point, what do I
lack to complete my earthly happiness, unless, possibly,
reconciliation with my son and his family?
I have, I think, a very beautiful and not ordinary
home here; nor have I neglected the immediate
surroundings. As I look down from my window,
my eyes are greeted by a gorgeous growth of foliage
that almost would do credit to the tropics. What
wonders fertilization and re-soiling have worked here!
The results far outweigh the expense. Madden still
dreams of his sanitarium. And what more suitable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
place than this! My remaining years may not be
many, and he is still a comparatively young man.
I can understand his great joy to learn, by the terms
of my will, that this mammoth place (a ‘white elephant,’
Harold calls it) will be placed at his disposal....
I owe it to him.”</p>

<p>A skip of five years.</p>

<p>“Kept in bed by a return of the dreaded symptoms,
I was unable this week to attend my son’s
funeral in Minneapolis, and thus, no doubt, am further
estranged from my unbending and now independently-wealthy
daughter-in-law. Would, though, that the
granddaughter might take a less harsh view of me.”</p>

<p>Another skip of five years.</p>

<p>“This has been an amazingly joyful week. My
granddaughter has been here—not, however, with
her mother’s consent or even to her mother’s knowledge!
What a wonderful child Ruth is, and how great
will be my joy to make her my heir. In this house
of an ‘an old man’s fancy,’ I showed her to-day the
hidden staircase behind the moon. She calls this
desert home of mine ‘Aladdin’s Palace,’ though
innocently dropping a remark the while to the effect
that her mother calls it the ‘Ogre’s Den.’ So I
am an ‘ogre’ in the eyes of my daughter-in-law!
Ruth undoubtedly has had to unlearn a lot of things
about me in the few days that she has been here.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
And she admits now that it was largely curiosity
to see the ‘ogre’ that brought her here. Her evident
affection for me, as she has come to really know me,
is a joy beyond words. To-morrow she goes on
to visit my cousin Samantha Doane, where she is
supposed to have been during the past week. May
it be that Samantha, good woman that she is, does
not implant in the younger mind the seed of too
vigorous conversation.”</p>

<p>“Laws-a-me!” burst out Mrs. Doane, looking at
us in turn with her big eyes. “What does he mean?—that
I talk too much?”</p>

<p>Poppy grinned, but didn’t answer.</p>

<p>“Again taken to my bed,” the millionaire wrote,
shortly before his death, “I have repeatedly tried
to get in touch with my granddaughter, through
Alonzo Chew, my lawyer, but she pays no attention
to my letters and telegrams. Is this the work of
her mother? I have tried to believe so. Yet the
child, with a mind of her own, found a way of coming
here last summer. So common sense tells me that
she could write to me if she wished. Can it be
true, as Chew says, that all she came for a year ago
was to fawn on a senile old man and thus insure her
heritage? She wants my money, he says, and getting
it, less than ever will she want to come to this isolated
home of mine. Chew is wiring her again to-day, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
I am on my deathbed, and that may bring her. We
had another long talk when he was here about those
poor people in the religious colony by the river. I
was surprised at his deep interest in them, and his
evident desire to help them to happier homes and
more productive surroundings. Rather than have
my wealth dissipated by a thankless younger relative,
how much finer, he has urged, that I might invest it
in the lives of these deserving people. I could do
for them, on their rather barren land, what I had
done for myself here. And the result, in their greater
happiness and added prosperity, would be a lasting
monument to my memory. I find myself so easily
led on by Chew, that I wonder at times, and anxiously,
if my mind is inhabited by its usual keenness....
To think that I should even consider disinheriting
my own grandchild!”</p>

<p>A skip of two days.</p>

<p>“Still not a line from Ruth. And this indifference
of hers, so heart-breaking to me, has led to the making
of a new will, though it isn’t the will that Chew tried
to urge on me. But I cannot bring myself to disinherit
my kin outright. Maybe, when I am gone,
Ruth will be filled with remorse over her present
conduct. And how tragic then that my fortune
should have passed into strange hands! No, I
have let the disposition of my property stand for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
year. And I can only hope that my grandchild, in
getting the keys of my home, as I intend sending
them to her through Dr. Madden, will understand
that I <i>want</i> her to come here. If she does come,
any time within a year after I am gone—and she
has until midnight of the last day—then the entire
estate will be hers, with the exception of this place,
which I want Dr. Madden to have, along with
the necessary endowment. If she doesn’t come,
proof to me that she has no happy recollection
of the hours that she spent here, the bulk of
the estate will be left as a religious trust fund, the
money to be disbursed locally by Chew as he
sees fit.”</p>

<p>The diary ended here. It had taken us about two
hours to go through it, though it hasn’t taken you
ten minutes to read what we picked out—only we
didn’t write it down at the time: I borrowed the
diary and did that afterwards.</p>

<p>We knew now <i>why</i> the big house had been built
here, a secret in itself, and <i>why</i> the body had smelt
of drugs. Every part of the dead man’s secret was
spread out in our understanding minds. We saw
into the lawyer’s scheme, too. He hadn’t written
to the granddaughter, at all. And probably he
had done everything he could to keep her away from
the closed-up house until the year was up. A lot of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
religious interest <i>he</i> had in the New Zion gang! If
they got anything at all out of the fortune, it would
be pennies that slipped through his greedy fingers.
In the diary, Mr. Danver had said something about
his head being on the bum. It sure had been on the
bum, all right, to make a will like <i>that</i>!</p>

<p>Oh, if only we could knock the props out from under
old fatty! It was an awful thought that he was
liable to win out. It fairly made us sick. But what
could we do? Certainly, it was too late to go to
Pardyville, even if we had known for sure that the
granddaughter was hiding there.</p>

<p>Another thing that put weight on our gloom was
Dr. Madden’s death. We had figured on him doing
something to-night to help the granddaughter. Now
he was gone. And unless he had made a further
confession at the hospital, before I talked with him,
we might never know <i>why</i> he had been hiding in the
closed-up house.</p>

<p>That he had “found” the diary, proved,
though, even more than the box of drugs in the
barn, that he <i>had</i> been hiding here. Reading the
book, and thus getting wise to old Chew’s dishonest
scheme, he had sent for the granddaughter,
who, in turn, had written to the two Doanes,
asking them to come on ahead and open up the place
for her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>But why had the “druggy” hider slammed the
door so mysteriously? Where did the gander come
in? And why had the granddaughter dropped out
of <i>his</i> sight as well as everybody else’s? Finally,
and most important of all, where was she?</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX<br>

<small>“MISS” POPPY OTT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Yes</span>, sir, the more we messed the matter around
in our minds the more we were made to realize how
very little Dr. Madden had told on himself. His
secrets were still shut up. And, “man of mystery”
that he was, the only reason why he had told us about
the hidden diary was to give the granddaughter a
square deal. Knocked out himself, he wanted us to
help her, if we could, and thus defeat the scheming
lawyer.</p>

<p>That old hunk of human fat! How we hated him!
We wanted to trim him to a frazzle. But how were
we going to do it? It looked kind of hopeless.</p>

<p>But Poppy isn’t the kind of a kid to give up without
a struggle. I guess not. And it was his gritty scheme
now to waylay the lawyer, when he came that night,
and lock him up in the barn. If necessary, we would
keep the human lard-pail shut up for several days,
which would give us a chance to look around for the
granddaughter. Then, if we found her, we would
turn him loose, and she could stare at him in surprise
and say: “Well, old hunk, where have <i>you</i> been all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
summer?” Do you catch on? Having been shut
up in the barn, he wouldn’t be able to <i>prove</i> that
she hadn’t tripped into the house in time to save her
fortune. A kind of tricky scheme, it’s true, but look
who we were fighting!</p>

<p>Ma, poor old soul, seemed sort of shrunken over
the fact that the red-plush settee hadn’t been mentioned
in the diary. She <i>just knew</i> that she wasn’t
going to get it. Or, worse, she might not get anything
at all! Never having heard people talk so open
and frank-like about such things, it was kind of
funny to us. But, bu-lieve me, we got the grin out
of our eyes in a hurry when the wilted little old lady
began to cry. We saw then how much the settee
meant to her. And realizing that she might get left
out, after all, we wondered if we couldn’t buy the
piece for her. We still had sixteen dollars.</p>

<p>To our surprise, young fatty breezed in just before
supper, having brought another doctor—a tall,
willowy geezer with mutton-chop whiskers and a jug-handle
nose. And speaking of noses, I wish you could
have seen squashy’s bugle. It was all over his face.
Like a big toadstool. And when he walked he sort
of <i>spraddled</i>.</p>

<p>“Where was the wreck?” grinned Poppy.</p>

<p>That made the kid furious. For he knew, of
course, who had sicked the hornets on him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>“I’ll ‘wreck’ you,” he fired at us, “if you don’t
crawl into a hole and shut up.”</p>

<p>Crawl into a hole for <i>him</i>? Oh, yes! We’d even
pull the hole in after us, if he said so. Like so much
mud!</p>

<p>Knowing his stuff, the new doctor soon found
out the truth about old Ivory Dome’s hives, and, in
consequence, down came the quarantine sign. It
was fatty, of course, who yanked the sign down.
But he met with a snag when he tried to call the
sheriff back. For the country officer wasn’t at home.</p>

<p>“Just the same,” the fat hunk blustered around,
as mean as mud, “you’ve got to git out of here—every
last one of you.”</p>

<p>Poppy had stood about enough.</p>

<p>“And suppose we don’t get out,” says he, kind of
screwing his eyes down to little black spots, “are
you going to <i>put</i> us out?”</p>

<p>Fatty saw that he was heading into trouble.</p>

<p>“My father will,” he blustered.</p>

<p>“With a posse, huh?”</p>

<p>“It won’t take much to put <i>you</i> out,” was slung
across the room, as the fat one’s temper got away
from him.</p>

<p>“No?” purred Poppy. “Would you like to try it
... yourself?”</p>

<p>“Two against one,” came the sneer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>Never have I known a kid who can hold his temper
any better than Poppy. And what the steady leader
did now, instead of soaking the fat smart aleck, was
to give me a wink.</p>

<p>“Get a tapeline, Jerry.”</p>

<p>“What for?” says I.</p>

<p>“We’re going to do some measuring.”</p>

<p>I caught on then, for once before we had pulled
this stunt of making a monkey out of the other guy.
And perfectly suited with the program, I borrowed
a tape measure from the housekeeper and got busy.</p>

<p>“Five feet six,” says I, giving fatty’s height.</p>

<p>Poppy gravely wrote that down.</p>

<p>“Twenty-eight inches from starboard to poop
deck,” says I, meaning across the hips.</p>

<p>That was written down, too.</p>

<p>“Eighteen inches under the cover,” says I.</p>

<p>The writer looked at me.</p>

<p>“Does that allow room on the breast for a wreath
of calla lilies?” he inquired solemnly.</p>

<p>“Maybe you better make it twenty inches,” I
corrected, not wanting to crush the funeral bouquet.</p>

<p>Fatty got away from me then.</p>

<p>“Don’t git fresh,” says he, scowling, “or you’ll
find yourself playing a harp.”</p>

<p>Poppy held his pencil ready.</p>

<p>“How many handles do you want on it?” says he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>“I’ll put a ‘handle’ on your nose, if you don’t
shut up.”</p>

<p>“Like your own, huh?” I put in.</p>

<p>“Three handles on a side is the usual plan,” says
the writer thoughtfully. “But maybe I better make
it four on a side for <i>you</i>.... East and west or north
and south?”</p>

<p>Old thick-skull wasn’t traveling fast enough
for us now.</p>

<p>“I mean,” the writer explained patiently, “do
you want us to dig the grave so it’ll lay east and west
or north and south?”</p>

<p>“Grave? Whose grave?”</p>

<p>“<i>Good</i> night!” I yipped. “You sure are dumb.
What did you think we were measuring you up for?
—a new dress suit?”</p>

<p>“Go lay an egg,” says fatty.</p>

<p>“And here’s a nice little epitaph to go on the
tombstone,” says Poppy:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Once I was fat and sassy—</div>
<div class="verse">The village shiek in my day—</div>
<div class="verse">Then I got too blamed brassy</div>
<div class="verse">And they tenderly laid me away—with a brick.</div>
</div></div>

<p>“I’ll ‘lay’ you away!”</p>

<p>Poppy suddenly dropped his game.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>“The point is, kid, that we’re harder than nails.
Our middle name is dynamite. When we hits ’em,
they lay. And while this may be a disappointment
to you, I’ll have to tell you outright that we don’t
intend to move out of here to-night. So, if you want
to stay here, yourself, the less you blow around about
putting us out, the better it will be for you. Do you
git me?”</p>

<p>The doctor driving away, Ma called us to supper,
and what do you know if fatty didn’t have the nerve
to park himself at the table along with the rest of us!</p>

<p>“It’s his scheme,” says Poppy, when we were
outside, “to wait here for his old man.”</p>

<p>“He’ll have a long wait,” I laughed, thinking of
how we were going to coop up the fat lawyer in the
bottle room.</p>

<p>“Maybe we ought to lock the kid up, too,” came
thoughtfully. “Then he won’t be able to give us away.”</p>

<p>I caught on. With the kid in the house, we
couldn’t very well let on afterwards that the granddaughter
had been there when it was known to him
that she wasn’t. Yet I didn’t like the idea of locking
him up. Too much of this “locking-up” stuff would
get us into trouble.</p>

<p>“Say, Poppy,” I laughed, as a crazy idea began to
stagger around in my head. “Do you want to do
the trick up right?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>“It’s a cinch,” came earnestly, “that I don’t
want to fumble.”</p>

<p>“Then listen to this,” I laughed again, more eager
to further make a monkey of fatty than to jump on
him. “We catch old law-book and lock him up.
Then, having drawn cuts, the short-straw fellow is
the ‘she.’”</p>

<p>“‘She?’ What she?”</p>

<p>“The granddaughter.”</p>

<p>I had him puzzled.</p>

<p>“For example,” I went on, “we’ll suppose that
you’re the ‘she.’ And having borrowed one of Ma
Doane’s petticoats, we dress you up in it. Then,
just before midnight the ‘granddaughter’ trips in.
Kisses and hugs at the front door. ‘Ruthie, dearest,
I’m <i>so</i> glad to see you—and did you have a pleasant
journey, my love?’ Fatty is there, taking it all in.
But gloom and disappointment for him. Do you
catch on?”</p>

<p>“Jerry, you’re cuckoo.”</p>

<p>“Cuckoo, nothing,” I hung on, seeing the fun
that we could have.</p>

<p>“Not me,” he held off.</p>

<p>“What are you scared of?”</p>

<p>“I’d feel cute dressed up like a girl!”</p>

<p>“It’ll be a scream.”</p>

<p>“Yah—for you!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>I was grinning more than ever.</p>

<p>“When you flutter in, kid, looking like Mary
Pickford on her wedding day, I’ll meet you at the
door and give you an old smacker right on the two-lip
bed.”</p>

<p>“It won’t work, Jerry. For I’m too bow-legged
to pass for a girl.”</p>

<p>“Say, what do you think we’re going to pull off?—a
bathing-beauty contest?”</p>

<p>“It would be a <i>side-show</i> if you had your way
about it.”</p>

<p>“Suppose your legs <i>are</i> sort of corkscrewed,” says
I, looking him over. “Your petticoat will cover that up.”</p>

<p>His eyes were dancing now. For big monkey that
he is, he’s as full of crazy fun as the next fellow.</p>

<p>“I get to fix the straws, huh?”</p>

<p>“Sure thing—if you don’t cheat.”</p>

<p>The straws fixed, I drew first, hopeful that I would
be luckier than the other time in the barn.</p>

<p>“Mine’s the shortest,” the other tried to snudge.</p>

<p>“Like so much mud!” I yipped happily.</p>

<p>Running into the house, we quickly told the little
old lady about our scheme.</p>

<p>“What nonsense!” she sputtered.</p>

<p>“But if we don’t do it, Mrs. Doane,” I hung on,
“how are we going to pretend afterwards that the
girl was here before midnight?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>“Oh, dear! I don’t want Miss Ruth to lose her
fortune. Even if I get nothing myself—and I
noticed several odd dishes in the cupboard just like
my company set—I don’t want Lawyer Chew to walk
off with everything.”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” says I quickly. “So any scheme
to help the granddaughter is worth trying.”</p>

<p>“I hardly know what to say. For after the way
things have been stirred up here, I haven’t confidence
in my judgment any more.”</p>

<p>“Which means ‘yes,’ huh?”</p>

<p>“But can you really do it?” came doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Leave it to old Poppy,” I bragged, slapping my
chum on the back. “He’s clever.”</p>

<p>“I won’t feel clever,” the other suffered in advance,
“with petticoats on.”</p>

<p>“You’ll make a swell flapper,” I stepped around.</p>

<p>Oh, boy, I kept thinking to myself, wasn’t I the
lucky little thing that it wasn’t me.</p>

<p>He gritted his teeth.</p>

<p>“Jerry, if you ever tell about this at home!...
Gr-r-r-r!”</p>

<p>Cornering old Goliath, whose hair, you’ll remember,
hung to his shoulders, we got busy on him with a
pair of shears. He didn’t mind. When we got
through with him he looked like a bald-headed convict.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>Working in the closed room, Ma’s fingers flew as
she took the hair as we clipped it and made it into
a wig. As a sort of rehearsal, I privately helped
Poppy into the outfit—and standing there in the
middle of the room, did he ever look like a whipped
puppy! First came slippers and long silk stockings.
Then a fancy petticoat of Ma’s. And over that a
hand-worked dress that the elder, fortunately, had
brought along as a present for the younger relative.
With the wig on, and his eyebrows touched up with a
burnt match, “Miss” Poppy Ott was the snappiest
little chicken that ever cracked a shiek’s heart.</p>

<p>Ma came back to the room.</p>

<p>“I swan!” she told Poppy. “You look more like
a girl than Miss Ruth, herself. For, if the truth is
known, <i>she</i> always acted like a tomboy.”</p>

<p>Poppy wiggled.</p>

<p>“It’s too tight,” he suffered at the waist.</p>

<p>“You don’t want to look like a tub,” I stood off
and admired him.</p>

<p>“I feel like a fool,” he grunted.</p>

<p>“Nix on the bass-drum talk,” says I. “Squeak.”</p>

<p>“What do you think I am?—a rusty hinge?”</p>

<p>“Make your voice sound like a girl’s.”</p>

<p>He puckered up gamely.</p>

<p>“And do I sound like a girl now?” he squeaked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>“You’ll do, Poppy,” I slapped him on the back.
“Gee, kid, you’re clever.”</p>

<p>“Remember,” he glared at me, as he powdered
his nose, “one word of this when we get home, and
your folks will pick you up with a blotter.”</p>

<p>We were all set now. And as it was getting close to
nine o’clock, we took old Goliath with us and went
out to the front gate, where we tied a rope from
pillar to pillar.</p>

<p>“The trick is,” Poppy explained to the giant,
“that we’ve got to stop old Chew from going into
the house. And being big and husky, we brought
you along to help us.”</p>

<p>“Sure thing,” waggled old baldy. “What do
you want me to do?—wring his neck?”</p>

<p>“He deserves it,” grinned the leader, “but I
guess we hadn’t better do that. For it might get
us into trouble with the law. A safer plan will be
to lock him up in the barn.”</p>

<p>Pretty soon the lawyer came along, having learned
from his smart son, of course, that the quarantine
sign was a trick.</p>

<p>“Gid-dap!” the driver flopped the lines, when the
horse stopped at the gate. But the old nag never
budged. Grumbling, the big one got out to see what was
wrong, which gave us a chance to tackle him, football
style, after which Goliath lugged him off to the barn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>With the horse and buggy out of sight, we ran back
to the kitchen, where we found young fatty helping
himself to one of Ma Doane’s choice apple pies. The
big pig! Poppy and I had spotted that particular
pie for ourselves.</p>

<p>The door-bell ringing at eleven-thirty, the fat kid
beat it into the hall, sure now, after an uneasy hour,
that his father had finally arrived to do the will
reading.</p>

<p>“Why,” came a familiar squeaky voice from the
open door, “if it isn’t little <i>Egg</i>bert!”</p>

<p>Now, I’ll admit right off the bat that this “girl”
stuff of ours was a crazy mess. We probably shouldn’t
have done it. Certainly, it didn’t get us anything
in the end. But, even so, before I go any farther, I
think I ought to hand old Poppy a hunk of praise.
For he sure was carrying out his part to perfection.
Not only did he <i>look</i> like a girl, but he acted like
one. His voice was a bit off-key, of course. But
that was nothing.</p>

<p>“Miss Ruth!” cried the housekeeper, playing her
part. “Miss Ruth has come at last!”</p>

<small>BEHIND THE MOON</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Well</span>, with all of Poppy’s cleverness, the wonder
to me is, as I look back, that fatty was fooled. For
he wasn’t a dumb-bell. Yet, to our good luck, he
never caught on. And if ever you saw a disappointed
face it was his, which showed plainly enough that he
knew how the will read.</p>

<p>Mrs. Doane was buzzing around like a bumblebee.
It was “dearie this” and “dearie that.” And when
“dearie,” in walking up and down the room, got out
a compact and powdered “her” nose, I thought I’d
die. Everything looked <i>so</i> natural, “she” purred—only
it was more of a squeak than a purr.</p>

<p>Having tried without success to get his mother on
the telephone, young fatty primped in front of the
hall mirror, to make himself pretty, and then sidled
up to the “heiress” on the sofa.</p>

<p>“How did you know it was me?” he blushed.</p>

<p>“Oh!... I’m a mind reader,” and the sick-calf
look that the “heiress” gave him out of the corner
of “her” eyes almost turned my stomach. But
fatty thought it was sugar and cream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>“Are you going to be here very long?” he inquired
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Pos-sibly.”</p>

<p>“Say, can I—I— I mean,” it finally tumbled
out, “can I have a date some night soon?”</p>

<p>“I’d love to, if—”</p>

<p>“If what?”</p>

<p>“If your mama will let you.”</p>

<p>“Huh! I don’t have to ask <i>her</i> to go out on a
date.”</p>

<p>“No-o?”</p>

<p>“I’m sixteen.”</p>

<p>“<i>Sweet</i> sixteen.”</p>

<p>“Gee!” says fatty, in clover.</p>

<p>“I suppose you’ll be getting married ... soon.”</p>

<p>“I guess I’d marry you, all right,” the fortune
hunter blurted out, “if I had a chance.”</p>

<p>“Silly!”</p>

<p>“It’s funny my father doesn’t come.”</p>

<p>“Hasn’t he been here at all to-night?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“And grandpa’s will hasn’t been read?”</p>

<p>“No.... Say, you won’t forget, will you?”</p>

<p>“About the date?”</p>

<p>“Sure thing.”</p>

<p>“Oh!... I’ll never forget <i>that</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>“And you know what you said,” reminded the
fast worker.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“About me—me— You know.”</p>

<p>“Getting married?”</p>

<p>“Sure thing. Maybe we will, some day.”</p>

<p>“Little me and little you?”</p>

<p>“I guess you’re making fun of me now.”</p>

<p>“How could I?”</p>

<p>“I’m not little.”</p>

<p>“I think you’re cute.... Does your nose always
look that way?”</p>

<p>“A hornet stung me.”</p>

<p>“You poor dear! If Aunty wasn’t looking, I’d
kiss it for you.”</p>

<p>Fatty almost fell off the sofa.</p>

<p>“Say—” he gurgled. “Say— Let’s go out and
sit in the hall.”</p>

<p>“Would you try to kiss me in the dark?”</p>

<p>“I would if I got a chance.”</p>

<p>“When you’re with the girl you love, you want
to be <i>brave</i> and take a chance.”</p>

<p>“Say, you aren’t like most girls.”</p>

<p>“I know that, all right.”</p>

<p>“But I like you the better for it.”</p>

<p>“You might not like me so well, if you knew
<i>everything</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>“Have you got another fellow?” came hastily.</p>

<p>“Oh, no! You’re the only lover I ever had.”</p>

<p>“I <i>do</i> love you.”</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>“There’s something about your voice that seems
familiar to me.”</p>

<p>“I probably whispered to you in your dreams.”</p>

<p>“I’ll dream about you to-night, all right.”</p>

<p>“You might not, if you knew <i>everything</i>.”</p>

<p>“Why do you keep saying that?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I just want to tease you.... There, the
clock struck midnight.”</p>

<p>“I guess you’re lucky.”</p>

<p>“In having you for a ... friend?”</p>

<p>“Yes ... sure thing. But that isn’t what I
meant.”</p>

<p>“No-o?”</p>

<p>“You’re lucky that you got here just when you
did.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you know about the will?”</p>

<p>“Grandpa’s will?”</p>

<p>“Sure thing. He was going to cut you off if you
hadn’t got here before midnight. I heard my father
tell my mother.”</p>

<p>“And now ... what do I get?”</p>

<p>“Everything.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>“And what do <i>you</i> get?”</p>

<p>“Nothing.”</p>

<p>“But you’ve got <i>me</i>.”</p>

<p>“I wish we were older.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“We’d get married right away.”</p>

<p>“And my money would be your money, wouldn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“Oh!...” fatty quickly covered up, “I wasn’t
thinking of <i>that</i>.”</p>

<p>“Of course not!”</p>

<p>“But we can be engaged. I think my father would
like it.”</p>

<p>“How romantic. Can’t we elope, too?”</p>

<p>Here the loud slamming of the kitchen door ended
the little comedy, and who should come steaming
into the house but old road-roller, himself. Say,
was he ever <i>mad</i> after his imprisonment in the barn.
Nor was he fooled a single instant by Poppy’s disguise.</p>

<p>“So it’s <i>you</i>?” he thundered, yanking the wig off.</p>

<p>The fat kid’s eyes almost popped out of his head.</p>

<p>“Say— Say—” Then his face got red.</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose you’ll want to keep that date
... now,” purred Poppy, who can take his medicine
with a grin.</p>

<p>“I’ll punch your head!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>“Trickery!” stormed the lawyer. “Base, degrading
trickery.”</p>

<p>“How about yourself?” Poppy slung back.</p>

<p>“Shut up! And more than that, pack up—the
whole caboodle of you—and git out of here.”</p>

<p>“That’s it, Pa. Kick ’em out. For they threw
hornets at me. And water, too.”</p>

<p>“They’ll suffer for this!”</p>

<p>“Maybe not as much as you think,” Poppy stood his
ground. “For we’ve got the goods on you, Mr. Lawyer
Chew. A diary that we found here tells how you
coaxed Mr. Danver to make a new will. You lied to him,
too. He asked you to write to his granddaughter, but
you never did. And the law’ll fix you for that.”</p>

<p>“Silence!”</p>

<p>“Poof!” Poppy snapped his fingers under the fat
nose. “You can yell your head off, you big bag
of wind, and you can’t scare <i>me</i>.”</p>

<p>“Git out of here!”</p>

<p>“Go for him, Pa. Throw him out.”</p>

<p>“Um ...” came a drawl from the door, and in
swung old Goliath. “Jest try puttin’ that boy out,
or the tother one, either,” says he, rolling up his
sleeves, “an’ see what happens.”</p>

<p>“Who are you?” came the further thunder.</p>

<p>“<i>Me?</i>” and the giant posed like an old fool. “I’m
jest little Red Riding Hood.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>“Are you the man who carried me to the barn?”</p>

<p>“Yep. An’ if Poppy says the word, I’ll carry you
to the front door an’ chuck you clean into the road.”</p>

<p>Here another voice spoke up.</p>

<p>“Stop!—all of you,” cried Mrs. Doane, and the
tired, defeated look on the woman’s thin white face
hurt me like a knife jab. “I’ve come to the end
of my rope.” She turned to Chew. “You have
won out. I’m sorry. And I shall forever hold it
against Corbin Danver for disinheriting his own kin.
There were a few things here that I wanted myself,”—the
poor old soul wiped her eyes—“but I can get
along without them. What hurts me worse is Miss
Ruth’s loss. She asked me to come here, and I did,
and I’ve done everything I could to find her, and to
help her. Now, I’m—I’m sick and weary of it all.
I’m going to bed. If the rest of you want to go to
bed, you’ll find plenty of rooms. In the morning
I’ll pack up my things and go home.... Good
night.”</p>

<p>Well, that sort of put an end to the scrap. But
I’m not so sure that old Chew wouldn’t have dumped
us out of the front door, all right, if it hadn’t been for
Goliath. Yes, the giant saved us ... and afterwards
we remembered it!</p>

<p>Poppy and I felt pretty sick as we crawled into
our bed in the big room. It was galling to us to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
old Chew win out. Of course, we hadn’t lost anything
ourselves. But we were on the granddaughter’s
side. And her loss was our loss, sort of.</p>

<p>Tap! ... tap! ... tap! ...</p>

<p>Jerked out of a crazy dream, I sat up in bed and
rubbed my eyes. The gander! It had tapped that
way to get into the house. How well I remembered
that night! And now it was tapping again. Somewhere
in the big room.</p>

<p>Excited, I got Poppy up. And between us we
traced the sound to one of the fancy cloth wall panels.
As I have written down, these panels were pictures.
And in this particular picture there was a big yellow
moon.</p>

<p>What was it the diary had said? The hidden
staircase behind the moon! There was a secret door
here. And if we could open it, the mystery would
be over.</p>

<p>Poppy told me then, in a low excited voice, why
he had been measuring the room that afternoon.
He had suspected that the wall before us was too
thick to be natural. Now, in quick measuring,
both in the big room and the one next to it, we found
that there was a four-foot secret wall chamber here.</p>

<p>And the way to get into that hidden room, where
the gander was still tapping, was through the “moon”
picture. We felt all over the wall for a hidden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
spring. Then we pressed the moon itself—and out
swung the whole panel!</p>

<p>“Urk! Urk!” says the spotted gander, acting
tickled to see us. “Urk! Urk!” and as though to
guide us, it turned and started up a flight of winding
stairs, flying from step to step.</p>

<p>We followed it, using our flashlight, which showed
us that the stairs went down, as well as up. I don’t
mind telling you that I kept pretty blamed close to
the leader. It was a spooky adventure, let me tell
you. Where was the gander taking us? What
was there up above? Was it a peril of some kind?
And surprised by us in its secret den, would it jump
at us and try to kill us, as it had tried to kill old
Ivory Dome in the barn? You can see what our
thoughts were like.</p>

<p>Coming to the top of the stairs, which had taken
us almost to the roof, we found ourselves in a little
room, which we learned afterwards was a secret
part of the big attic. Here we found a cot. And
sound asleep on the cot was a <i>girl</i>. The prettiest
girl I’d ever seen in all my life.</p>

<p>The granddaughter! We had found her hiding
place at last! But who could have dreamed that
the hiding place was <i>here</i>?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br>

<small>ON THE ROAD AGAIN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Well</span>, I’m pretty close to the end of my story now.
And to sort of hurry things along, I’m not going to
write down, word for word, what everybody in the
house said and did in the next few hours, for, as you
can imagine, there was a lot of tumbling, rambling
talk when we took the granddaughter to Mrs. Doane.
Instead, I’ll go ahead, in my own words, and clear
up the mystery for you.</p>

<p>To start with, Dr. Madden wasn’t dead at all.
He had fainted during his talk with me on the telephone,
and that is what had given me the idea that
he was gone. I’m glad to say that he got well, and
now is in his right mind, which he <i>wasn’t</i> before the
accident, for he had something to tell the medical world
that would have been a big loss if the secret had died
with him. Can’t you guess now why he was hiding
in the big house? It was to complete his “cure” for
the fatal jungle disease. Experiments had been
going on for years, and if the millionaire had lived
another twelve months he would have been completely
cured. Upon his death, which halted the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
experiments, Dr. Madden put some of the impure
blood into his own body, so that he could go ahead
with his work. And, as I say, in the year that he
secretly doped himself with drugs, he found a complete
cure—he was bright enough on that point, but I
guess the <i>solitude</i> of the big empty house got the
best of him. I don’t mean he was crazy—just <i>queer</i>.</p>

<p>It was quite by accident that he found the diary.
Reading it, to learn if it was his duty, as a friend
who knew its probable secrets, to destroy it, he thus
had found out about the lawyer’s trickery. But
instead of writing and telling the granddaughter
who he was and <i>why</i> she ought to be in the big house
when the will was read, he worded his letter so
<i>crazy-like</i>, with such queer reference to the dead
man’s diary, that the letter frightened her. She
knew all about the big fortune that was waiting to
be divided up, and while she had no proof that her
grandfather wanted her to have the most of it, still
she had been told certain things by Chew, as I’ll
mention later. And this mysterious, rambling letter,
signed by “a friend,” urged her to do things that the
lawyer had told her not to do. You can see the sort
of “up-a-tree” fix that she was in. One man told her
to keep away, the other told her to come. And each
one hinted that if she didn’t do as he said she would
cross her grandfather’s wishes. So it isn’t so strange<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
that she made up her mind to come to the big house
<i>secret-like</i>, where she intended to get the diary and
find out the truth. Yet she hadn’t the nerve to
come to the big house alone. And her mother being
in Europe, she got the idea of having two older
relatives open up the house for her. Afterwards
she would beg their pardon for worrying and mystifying
them. And to that point, only the woman was
to be left mystified, for it was the girl’s intention to
take the old man into her confidence.</p>

<p>As we know, the house keys had been sent to her—which
was the first she knew that her grandfather
was dead—and to his own ends Chew craftily “explained”
that she now was the “custodian” of the
house, with the duty of seeing that it was kept
<i>completely closed</i>, the dead man’s last wish. It was
further hinted that unless she did this she would lose
her heritage. Nor did Chew intend to send for her
when the will was read. By keeping her away a
year, as he had kept her away from the funeral, he
would practically get control of everything, and that,
of course, is what he was after. Hence the girl took
particular pains to caution the two Doanes not to
let anybody know that they were living in the big
house. How Ma spilled the beans, though, we already
know.</p>

<p>On the train the girl got the frightened idea that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
a man in “green goggles” was secretly watching her.
And when this man followed her from the train in
Pardyville, she ran back to her seat, hurriedly writing
a note to old Ivory Dome, which note was left with
the ticket agent. In leaving home that morning, a
boy friend had laughingly given her a pet gander,
which he had fixed up in a crazy way with purple
ink spots—though what the complete joke was about
the gander the girl never told us! I have a hunch,
though, that she was kind of sweet on the guy!
Anyway, she kept the gander, which was checked to
Pardyville. So old Ivory Dome got it, along with
the note, when he finally rolled in, twenty minutes
late.</p>

<p>The note said that he was to turn back on C. H. O.
and keep going until he met the girl on the road, as
it was her intention to go to Sandy Ridge, the next
stop, and take a taxicab from there. In the meantime,
a fence had been put across C. H. O., but old
Ivory Dome didn’t let that stop him! Whether he
went around it, or over it, we don’t know. But we
do understand now how he happened to have the
whole road to himself, and why he passed the sandy
crossroad. The concrete having “bulged” dangerously,
a mile east of Sandy Ridge, the road had been
shut off for temporary repairs. The taxicab brought
the girl that far, where old Ivory Dome picked her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
up. With his promise to keep her secret, she had
gotten out of the car before the tip-up. On the east
side of the stone house a vine frame cleverly hid a
secret door, at the foot of the wall staircase, and
going there, while we were fussing over the unconscious
man, she found the door <i>open</i>! She didn’t
know, of course, that Dr. Madden was living in the
secret room. He had gone outside, at the time
of the accident, and later was unable to get back in,
for the girl had locked the door on the inside. So
now we know why he watched the house that night
in the storm.</p>

<p>He tried again the next night to get into the
house, but to no success. Later that night he followed
us to the barn, after the girl had put the gander in our
room to get us away, so that she could clean out the
desk in the hope of finding the diary. You will
remember, we went into the barn first, then Dr.
Madden, then old Ivory Dome. And right here I
think I ought to say a few words about the old man.
A queer codger, he wasn’t half as crafty as we had
imagined. It is true that he had promised the granddaughter
to keep her secret, but in the automobile
accident everything in his thick head had been
turned upsidedown. His dumbness wasn’t put on.
<i>Why</i> he went to the barn, we’ll never know. But I
think he remembered, sort of vague-like, that there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
was a <i>secret</i> about the gander, and that may have
been why it attracted him. The girl came back to
the barn to get the gander, for company, screaming
when she saw a “ghost.” And the rest you know.</p>

<p>The next morning, before putting old Chew wise to
the truth, Poppy went to him with a long face.</p>

<p>“Mr. Chew,” says he meekly, “is it possible for
you to let bygones be bygones and do me a favor?”</p>

<p>“No, sir!” the old tub thundered, with hatred in
his green eyes. “You’ll get no favors from me. To
the contrary, I’m going to make you sweat for last
night’s attack. You’ll suffer under the law for that.”</p>

<p>Poppy was crushed, and showed it.</p>

<p>“I was going to ask you,” he hung his head, “if
you cared if Mrs. Doane took home the red-plush
settee in the hall.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Doane will get <i>nothing</i> out of this house.”</p>

<p>“Maybe you’ll sell it to us, so we can give it to her.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t sell it to you for a thousand dollars,”
came meanly, “if I knew she wanted it.”</p>

<p>Some old hog, huh? Well, I’m glad to write down
in conclusion that the good old lady <i>did</i> get her settee—with
ten thousand dollars on top of it—and all
fatty got, after all of his crooked work, was what
the little boy shot at. Which is the way things
should be.</p>

<p>To show you how much “brotherly love” he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
for the New Zion bunch, he practically put them out
of business by making them pay fourteen per cent
on money that they owed the Danver estate. The
estate got five per cent and old grab-it-all got the
rest!</p>

<p>And thus reminded of old Goliath, you’ll give us
the horselaugh when I tell you the truth about <i>him</i>.
He wasn’t married at all. Furthermore, he was the
only man left in the religious camp—he was so hard-boiled
and such a liar that the others, in moving away,
wouldn’t even take him with them, though earlier
they had tried to use him and reform him. No
wonder the “town” had looked deserted the day we
rode through it in state—after having coughed up
two dollars for the privilege! The houses had been
empty for six months. And we had swallowed that
“picnic” story! Old Goliath sure worked us slick.
I suppose he’s laughing about it to this day. Well,
we should worry. We still have his hair!</p>

<p>The balance of our hitch-hike was kind of tame.
So we were glad to get home. And to that point,
we hadn’t been home a week before we were mixed
up in the Pedigreed-Pickle business that the Tutter
people are still laughing over. Can you imagine
Poppy standing up to his neck in cucumber pickles?
It was his job to sell the pickles—but before he could
<i>sell</i> them he had to <i>make</i> them. I can still see that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
mountain of cucumbers. “It’s no use,” says I,
in despair. “We can’t do it.”</p>

<p>But we did. And <i>how</i> we did it—bucked by a mean
rich kid, and with a mystery hanging over us that gave
us shivers one minute and completely tangled us up
the next—is, I believe, a story that you won’t want
to miss.</p>

<p>So tighten up your buttons for the biggest laugh
of your lifetime, for we’ll soon be there in POPPY
OTT’S PEDIGREED PICKLES.</p>

<p class="ph2">THE RIDDLE CLUB BOOKS</p>

<p class="ph3">By ALICE DALE HARDY</p>

<p class="ph1">Individual Colored Wrappers. Attractively Illustrated.<br>
Every Volume Complete in Itself.</p>

<p>Here is as ingenious a series of books for little folks as
has ever appeared since “Alice in Wonderland.” The idea
of the Riddle books is a little group of children—three girls
and three boys decide to form a riddle club. Each book is
full of the adventures and doings of these six youngsters,
but as an added attraction each book is filled with a lot of
the best riddles you ever heard.</p>

<p class="hl">THE RIDDLE CLUB AT HOME</p>

<p>An absorbing tale that all boys and girls will enjoy reading.
How the members of the club fixed up a clubroom in the Larue
barn, and how they, later on, helped solve a most mysterious
happening, and how one of the members won a valuable prize,
is told in a manner to please every young reader.</p>

<p class="hl">THE RIDDLE CLUB IN CAMP</p>

<p>The club members went into camp on the edge of a beautiful
lake. Here they had rousing good times swimming, boating
and around the campfire. They fell in with a mysterious old man
known as The Hermit of Triangle Island. Nobody knew his
real name or where he came from until the propounding of a
riddle solved these perplexing questions.</p>

<p class="hl">THE RIDDLE CLUB THROUGH THE HOLIDAYS</p>

<p>This volume takes in a great number of winter sports, including
skating and sledding and the building of a huge snowman.
It also gives the particulars of how the club treasurer lost the
dues entrusted to his care and what the melting of the great
snowman revealed.</p>

<p class="hl">THE RIDDLE CLUB AT SUNRISE BEACH</p>

<p>This volume tells how the club journeyed to the seashore and
how they not only kept up their riddles but likewise had good
times on the sand and on the water. Once they got lost in a fog
and are marooned on an island. Here they made a discovery
that greatly pleased the folks at home.</p>

succeeded. The whole recorded in a series of screams and
